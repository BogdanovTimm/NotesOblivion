# Definition

If we have 2 situations:
- Scientist explain something in scientific terms
- Somebody claims that some action is bad

These situations are not equal. 

So, **inference to the best explanation** in **ethics** does **not work**.

# Funny

Gilbert Harman is a proponent of inference to the best explanation. He suggest these claim in its introduction to metaetchics.
