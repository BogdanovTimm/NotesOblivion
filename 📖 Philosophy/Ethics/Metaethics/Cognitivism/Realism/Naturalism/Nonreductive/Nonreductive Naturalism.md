Philosophers sometimes use the word ‘reduction’ to specify an identity  relation and sometimes to refer to some sort of composition or constitution relation. Some even seem to use it for a supervenience relation, but I think  they are best understood as using it for a composition or constitution relation that explains why supervenience holds. Still others use the term ‘reduction’ to pick out a priori knowable relations of these two sorts, identity or  composition. 

A self-described “nonreductive naturalist” might be using  ‘reductive’ in any of these senses:
- They might be **denying** that they take their position to have **a priori** status.
- Or they may be **denying** that we have any way of **specifying in nonmoral terms** the **natural property** that is **identical** with the **moral property** in question. 
- Or they might be **denying** that  they are **identifying moral properties with nonmoral properties rather than  postulating a constitution or composition** relation.
