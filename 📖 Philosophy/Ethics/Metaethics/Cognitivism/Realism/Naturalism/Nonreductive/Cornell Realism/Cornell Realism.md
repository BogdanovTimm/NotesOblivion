# Definition

The project  of assimilating moral epistemology and moral metaphysics to the epistemology and metaphysics of the sciences.

They also tried to infuse the resulting  account with an updated conception of scientific kinds, the meanings of  scientific words, and of scientific epistemology.


# Assumptions

- [[Direct Reference Theory]] of language is true
- Accepts the first claim from [[Nonreductive Naturalism]] - that **knowledge of  identity or constitution relations** in the **moral** realm are **a priori** accessible.
- It will turn out that certain sorts of [[Internalism]] might be compatible with major components of the Cornell  Realist view. There seem to be two ways that a commitment to even defeasible morals/motives and morals/reasons [[Internalism]] might follow from a  Cornell-style realist view:
	- One just has to do with the nature of the moral  properties identified with rightness, wrongness, goodness, and so on. If the  property in question is not plausibly one that people inevitably desire or  have reason to desire, even under ideal conditions, we should not think there is any necessary connection between moral rightness (or whatever) and  reasons or motivation. 
	- The other has to do with the nature of the reference  relation and with a specific way that many realist externalists formulate their externalism.
	- As for the judgement internalism - For  you could be competent with the term and use it as a tag for a reason-giving  property and yet not know that the property was reason-giving. At least that  would seem to be true if you think of terms as just tags. 

# Pros

- It is immune to [[Moore's Open Question]]
- 

# Authors

These theorists were dubbed  “Cornell Realists” because most of them had some connection to Cornell  University, either as graduate students or as professors.

Richard Boyd, David Brink, and Nick Sturgeon are paradigm Cornell Realists, and Peter Railton’s  ideas make him a comfortable fit in this group.
