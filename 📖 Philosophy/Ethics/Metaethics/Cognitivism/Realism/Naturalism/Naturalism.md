# Definition

**Moral properties supervene on natural properties**: **two** possible actions **canâ€™t differ in their rightness** (for example) **without** also **differing in** their perfectly **natural properties**, at least in the world as it is.

Types of naturalisms:
- **identifying** the **moral with** the **natural**
- **moral is constituted by** the **natural**
- **moral supervence on natural** porpetries

Is the action **right because I** would **choose it in conditions of full information** and imaginative acquaintance, **or** do **I choose it  because it is right**? 

The underlying thought seems to be that we want to say the latter but that a reduction of rightness to a property essentially about the ideal responses of observers or agents reverses that order of explanation.
