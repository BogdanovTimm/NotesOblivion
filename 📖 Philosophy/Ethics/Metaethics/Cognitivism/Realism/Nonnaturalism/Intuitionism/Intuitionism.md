# Definition

## 3d eye

We have some **special sense** - sense to **see moral properties**.

## Ability to judge

We take both **empirical facts** and **synthetic a priory knowledge** about `right`

# Pros

It allows us to accept the [[Moore's Open Question]] but still think that moral properties are objective. 

# Cons

- It requires postulating that **there is a new human sense** - **intuitive sense** among vision, hearing, etc.
- Sharon Street shows, that if our **moral intuitions** are **depended on evolution**, than our **moral intuitions** are **not objective** - we may **evolve differently** and then our **moral intuitions would be different**.
