It is a counter argument against Simple [[Subjectivism]]

1. **Moral truths** are modally **necessary** true.
2. My **psychological attitudes** are modally **contingently** true.
3. Suppose, that **moral truths** = **my attitudes**.
4. Then, both **moral truths** and **my attitudes must be of equal modal**.
5. But, **moral truths** are modally **necessary**, while my **psychological attitudes** are modally **contingent**.
6. So, **moral truths != not my attitudes**.
