# Definition

A moral judgement `X` is right says that the action is of a type approved of by the smallest social group including all of (1) the agent, (2) the speaker or appraiser, and  (3) the intended audience (if there is one). 

# Pros

This would let us, that is you  and me, avoid endorsing Hitler’s choices. There’s no group that includes all of us and Hitler as well that share the relevant attitudes.
