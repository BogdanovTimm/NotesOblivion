# Definition

Error theorist claims one or more of these:
- Some error theorists express this thought by suggesting that all moral claims are false. 
- Others endorse a more qualified but still comprehensive thesis, that all positive moral claims are false. 
- the problems go beyond false presupposition, to something like failure to pick out a subject matter at all. On such views ethical judgements purport to represent the world, but fail.

# Arguments

Arguments for Error theory presented in 2 variants:
- Epistemic ones
- Metaphysical ones

See:
- [[Mackie]]
- [[ðŸ“– Philosophy/Ethics/Metaethics/Cognitivism/Error Theory/Sharon Street]]
# Assumptions

They are cognitivists:
- moral judgements are beliefs
- moral sentences typically express these beliefs
- the meaning of such moral sentences is representational.

So they believe that sentences deploying  moral predicates like â€˜right,â€™ â€˜wrong,â€™ â€˜good,â€™ and so on, have truth conditions, predicate properties, and express propositions. These judgements and sentences would be true if the world were as these judgements and sentences represent it to be.

Yet they are not minimal realists because they think moral judgements fundamentally misrepresent reality.

Many of Error Theorist assume that Frege's philosophy of language is true.

# Counter arguments

If all premises of an error theory do not work for normative claims (not all normative claims are moral claims) - it is a problem for error theorists.
