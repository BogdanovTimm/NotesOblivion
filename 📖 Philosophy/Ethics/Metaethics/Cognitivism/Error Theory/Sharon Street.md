## Argument for Error Theory against Intuitionism and a priory moral judges

1. The **moral claims** we accept are largely **determined by the psychological propensities we have evolved** to manifest. ([[Intuitionism]])
2. The selective **processes that shaped our psychological propensities favored** propensities that generate **judgements that lead to reproductive success**. 
3. **If** the truth about **morality** is **independent of our judgements** about morality, the truth of such reproductive success enhancing **judgements** is **not relevant to** their **promotion of reproductive success**. 
4. Therefore, any **correlation between our propensities to judge** one way or another **and** such **judgement independent truth would be unlikely**. 
5. **Unless** our **propensities to make moral judgements were generated by processes that favor true moral judgements** over false moral judgements, **we have no reason to think that our moral commitments are true** rather than false. 
6. **We have no reason to believe that the moral judgements** we are inclined to make **are true** or reliable **if moral truth is independent of our judgements about morality**. 
7. Thus **either moral truths depend on our propensities to judge**, **or we have no reason to think our moral beliefs are accurate**.

This argument, actually, do a favor for Response-dependent theories (theories, according to which the truths of morality are truths about our  dispositions to respond to what we evaluate).
