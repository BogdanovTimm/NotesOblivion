# Meaningless of Etchis

According to A. J. Ayer, they are 2 sorts of propositions:
- tautologous - ones true by definition
- non-tautologous - ones that has empirical facts about it
- meaningless - non-tautologous that don't have empirical facts about them

Because moral propositions are not tautologous and they are not  empirical - they are meanigless.
