# Definition

Prescriptivists start from claims about language, likening moral sentences to imperatives apt for speech acts of prescribing. On the simplest versions of the view,  ‘Killing is wrong’ just means the same thing as ‘Do not kill.’ 

# Cons

We can't use imperatives in if-then conditionals, while we can use moral sentences in them.
