# Definition

The basic  hybrid idea is that moral sentences have ordinary representational meaning,  while also expressing (either semantically or pragmatically) additional noncognitive content. 

To treat the  expressive content as semantic would be to treat it as conventionally encoded  in the meanings of the terms used. This would be analogous to the way the  non-hybrid emotivist thinks of the expressive component in moral semantics.  It just is a matter of convention that these words convey these attitudes.  

The hybrid theorist who goes this route only adds that the terms also have  a representational semantic component. For example, a hybrid theorist could  think that a term like ‘morally right’ meaning which makes it apt both for  picking out some natural property such as promoting human health and  for at the same time expressing a positive attitude toward that property.

A rough translation might then  be, “Expanding Medicare would promote human health and Hurrah for  promoting human health!”

# Pros

One motivation for going hybrid has been  that such theories offer to help meet the Frege-Geach desiderata.
