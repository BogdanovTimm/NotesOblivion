Emotivists tell us that moral  terms function as expressives to express pro or con attitudes toward the items  of which they are predicated. And that is not implausible when such predications are employed in freestanding indicative sentences. 

‘Cursing is wrong,’  when used to make an assertion does plausibly express a negative attitude  toward cursing. 

But when someone says, “If cursing is wrong, then   frankness is too,” it isn’t obvious that they express any negativity toward cursing. It doesn’t seem that here the moral predicate’s meaning is well-explicated by talking about its attitude-expressing function. Here it is doing  something else.
