# Definition

To be `metaethical internalist` is either:
- to believe that ethics may motivate someone to act
- to believe that ethics always motivate someone to act


# Types of Internalism

Types of Internalism:
- Group 1:
	- Morals/reasons = morals and reasons are somehow connected (reasons make things rational. If something is rational for you (aka it has a reason for you) and you don't do it - you are irrational).
	- Morals/motives = morals and motives are somehow connected
	- Reasons/motives = reasons and motives are somehow connected
- Group 2:
	- Judgment internalism - moral judgements must be connected with reasons or motives (or desires)
	- Existence internalism - moral facts (properties) must be connected with reasons or motives (or desires)
- Group 3:
	- Defeasible internalism - Morals or reasons may motivate someone (for example, only rational agents. Irrational people will not be motivated by their moral positions)
	- Indefeasible internalism - morals or reasons always motivate someone

You need to combine properties of all 3 groups, so you may be an `indefeasible morals/motives judgment internalist` and so on.

# Notes

It should be related with Humean idea that motives for action must be based on pre-existing desire.
