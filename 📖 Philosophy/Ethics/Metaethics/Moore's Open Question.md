# Definition

## Reconstruction 1

1. We can meaningfully ask, “Is `that which we desire to desire` = `good`?” (though, there can be every other definition of the `good`)  *(Premise)*
2. We could not meaningfully ask, “Is `what we desire to desire` = `what we desire to desire`?” *(Premise)*
3. An analysis of a concept captures the contribution of that concept to the contents of thoughts in which they occur. *(Premise)*
4. If we analyze `good` as `what we desire to desire`, the question in 1 should be analyzed as asking something equivalent to, “Is `what we desire to desire` = `what we desire to desire`?” *(From 1 and 3)*
5. If one can meaningfully use a sentence to express a thought, one can  meaningfully use any sentence that would be used in giving a correct analysis of the contents expressed by the first sentence to express the same thought. *(Premise)*
6. Thus, “Is `what we desire to desire` = `what we desire to desire`?” is not a correct analysis of “Is `what we desire to desire` = `good`?” *(From 4 and 5)*
7. Thus also, that `such-and-such` = `good` is not the same thought as the thought that `such-and-such` = `what we desire`. *(From 3 and 6)*

### Counter argument using Frege's philosophy of language

Moore assumes that 2 terms should have same sense to have same meaning. But, in Frege's philosophy of language, it is not true, because `H20` and `water` may have same referent, but do not have same sense - so, `H20` and `water` have different meanings, but same referent. Same, `good` and, for example, `pleasure` will have different meanings, but same referent

## Reconstruction 2

This reconstruction of Moore's Open Arguments cannot be destroyed by Frege's philosophy of language.
#MetaethicsAcontemporaryIntroduction 

1. Moore wonders whether `pleasure` = `good`. *(Premise)* 
2. When you wonder whether `something` = `good` you don’t believe that it is `good`. *(Premise)*
3. Moore does not believe `pleasure` = `good`. *(From 1. and 2.)*
4. Moore believes that `goodness` = `good`. *(Premise)* 
5. So, `goodness` and `pleasantness` differ in respect of what Moore believes about them. (He believes that one is good, but he isn’t sure about the other.) 
6. But by the **principle of the indiscernibility of identicals**, if `X` is identical with `Y`, then `X` and `Y` are indiscernible, that is they have all their properties in common. *(Premise—sometimes known as **Leibniz’s Law**)*
7. Thus `goodness` and `pleasantness` are distinct. *(From 5. and 6.)*

# If Moore is Right

If Moore is right, we have 3 possibility:
- `Good` = some `normative property`
- There is no `Good`
- There is only 1 `moral property` - but it is false, because different people has different meanings about what `good`, `bad` and other `moral properties` mean

# Counter arguments

If Open Question is relevant argument, then we can't be sure that ice is H20.

# Naturalistic Fallacy

For **Moore** it means a **1 way of reaching the conclusion** that `good` = `something else`.

For others it means **any conclusion** that `moral properties` = `natural properties`.
#MetaethicsAcontemporaryIntroduction 

# Natural Properties

`Natural properties` for **Moore** are those properties that both **nor moral** and **nor supernatural**.

But most philosopher think that:
- `natural properties` = properties that may be **explored by sciences**
- `naturalism` = belief that **there are** some **properties** that may be **explored by sciences**

# Moore's answer

Moore countenanced two basic modes  by which we could talk and think about things and by which our words  could come to designate them:
- One method was mediated by an identifying  description known to the thinker. - When designation is secured via a mediating description, the terms we  use pick out their referent in virtue of match between that description and  the thing we designate. So this kind of thought is satisfactional, referents  get to be referents by satisfying the mediating description. Furthermore it  seems that the mediation must be conscious to the thinker and speaker. The  description that determines the referent of my terms must be one that  I consciously employ. The basic idea seems very much a version of Fregean  notions that distinguish sense and reference and hold that sense determines  reference. But Moore’s version of the idea has some interesting further features. Moore also thought that the mediating description should involve the  real nature of the thing to which we refer and about which we think. At  the very least it should tell us something important about how it is composed. And it should be sufficiently informative about it that we could use  the description to tell someone what we are talking about in such way that  they could come to know it (Moore, 1903, pp. 7–8). It falls out of this  pretty quickly that the mediating conception must be complex. Teh Open Question Argument seems to close of fthis way of securing  reference to moral properties in thought or talk. A competent thinker like  Moore could at once think about a moral property and at the same time  doubt any description of it. Given the assumption of transparency, that rules  out every description as a candidate for the reference determining sense.
- The other was via acquaintance. Moore seems to endorse a more demanding notion of acquaintance,  one on which I myself need to be directly in contact with a simple referent  in order for my terms and thoughts to really be about it. By  Moore’s lights this left the other option, acquaintance, as the sole means by  which we could come to talk about moral properties and know what we are  talking about. 

## Counter arguments

### Hare's Missionaries and cannibals

Hare's Missionaries and Cannibals story - Suppose that  competence with some predicate consisted in being acquainted with it so  that one gained a recognitional capacity—the ability across a range of circumstances to recognize it when you see it. This seems to be what Moore  means by intuition, the capacity that allows us to have moral knowledge.  If two people claim to have this capacity with respect to some property that  they express with a certain predicate, we may come to wonder whether they  are picking out the same property. Given that Moore’s story rules out their telling us about its nature via some description, the best way to check would  seem to be to figure out whether they think this property has the same extension. If, as with the Missionaries and Cannibals, they each apply the  predicate to a very different set of things, we would seem to have to conclude  that they have intuitive acquaintance with difefrent properties but just happen to use the same word for these properties. But, Hare points out, that  isn’t what we want to say about the Missionaries and Cannibals when the  word in question is a general term of commendation. We instead want to  say they mean the same thing with that word. If the intuitive acquaintance  model generates a different verdict, so much the worse for that model. 

### Direct Reference theories

One way of thinking of the direct reference proposal is as broadening the  notion of the kind of acquaintance necessary to think and talk about a thing.  One no longer has to have been personally introduced to it as it were. One  just has to stand in some epistemically fruitful causally mediated relation to  it. Direct acquaintance will give you that. But so will being in a position  to use a name that has been passed on from those who had the right kind  of acquaintance relations. And so will being in a causally mediated feedback  loop that allows one to find out more about the very thing you are using  your words to designate. This puts us in a position to think and talk about  things with which we are not directly acquainted, while not having that  ability mediated by some descriptive sense that the referents of our words  must satisfy. On this way of thinking Moore has offered us a false dilemma.  We don’t have to choose between direct acquaintance or a Fregean sense  that must fit the referent of our terms. Two further features of the Moorean  picture are abandoned along the way. One is transparency to consciousness  of the mechanism whereby we manage to refer. Once that mechanism can involve causal and social mediation outside the mind, there’s no reason to  think we have to be in a position to know all of what needs to be true for  our terms to pick out the things they do. Secondly, we give up on Moore’s  assumption that the real nature of the things we think about can be known  through a priori analysis. We can know very little about the things to which  we refer, and what we know may be inessential to them. The access we have  to their real natures may be empirical and mediated by exactly the same  causal links that allow us to think of them. 

### Lewis advocay of he Ramsey method for defining theoretical terms

The method by which our predicates come to stand for certain  properties may be satisfactional, but the conditions that must be satisfied  may not be obvious. 

On the one hand they may be quite complicated. And,  through the deference of some speakers to the expertise of others, they may  be socially mediated so that what matters is the best systemization of a  group’s criteria for the use of a term. 

Further complication is added by the  fact that various moral terms all need to be defined at once because they  are linked in various ways. 

So we get a different strategy for resisting the  Open Question Argument. Predicates can pick out properties in a  description-mediated way, but not via a description that every competent  speaker must be in a position explicitly to know.
