- Ignorance and inattention normally regarded as culpable actually result from one’s appearance of the good; since we cannot control this appearance, we cannot be held responsible for the results of acting on it
- Non-sceptics cannot achieve complete freedom from the disturbance that results from passions, because some of this disturbance is inevitable and independent of belief; but since he achieves freedom from the dogmatists’ disturbance and adds no new disturbance of his own, his passions are less disturbing than the dogmatist’s passions (P i 29–30). He thereby achieves ‘the most complete (teleiotatˆ en) happiness’
- The Sceptics agree with their dogmatic opponents that belief (doxa) is to be understood as a normative state; we form a belief by an attempted assessment of the evidence, and if we change our view about the evidence, we change our belief. Sceptics agree that dogmatists have beliefs, since their view of the world rests on an attempted rational assessment of the evidence. The dogmatists are wrong, however, to suppose that they rationally assess the evidence. Since Sceptics see the dogmatists’ error, they give up forming beliefs. Their yielding to appearances is not belief, because it does not rest on an assessment of evidence, and therefore it is non-normative. The meat in the display case looks bright red, but if we are dogmatists we may not infer that it is red, if we remember that a red light is shining on it. The evidence that would otherwise persuade us to believe that the meat is red is open to question once we remember the red light shining on the meat, and so we will not hastily infer that the meat is fresh. Next, we do not take the further step of considering whether it is really how it looks.
- Aristotelian deliberation involves a rational estimate of grounds for preferring one or another option, and our election is guided by this rational estimate. Sceptics accept this description of deliberation, and therefore give up deliberation, because they make no rational estimates.
