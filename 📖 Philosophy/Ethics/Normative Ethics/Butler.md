- Self-interest conflicts with interest of others
- Rejects the supremacy of reasons based on one’s own good for being moral
- argument Butler urges against Hobbes: the claim that we do everything as a means to our own satisfaction does not explain why we find our satisfaction where we do; contrary to the egoist view, our finding satisfaction in getting x presupposes a desire for x itself, which explains why we get the satisfaction in x rather than y.
- Holistic Naturalism (Human nature os a system of some tendencies of people. But not all tendencies are part of human nature) is true
- The Naturalism is true. Human functionis to be guided by practical reason
- In unself i sh concern A wants to do x for B, simply because B wants x done or because it would be better for B, not because A gains any further benef i t from doing x. A shows this concern for B if A moves to one side to avoid walking over B’s gouty toes, when A has nothing else to gain by doing this. This is the unself i sh sentiment whose reality Butler defend against the psychological egoism of Hobbes
- Butler distinguishes the respect in which illness and health are equally natural from the respect in which health is more natural than illness.
- Non-eudamonism moralism is true: happiness is not needed for a sufficient justification of virtue.
- Butler argues that the principle of self-love is not supreme, but is subordinate to conscience. Self-love and conscience are distinct superior principles, but conscience is supreme. He therefore denies that they are equally ultimate principles
- Rejects this primacy of self-love. 
- Butler says that the rational pursuit of happiness gives us the reason that impartial justice is even more rational that pursuit of happiness
- Rejects eudaemonism
- The distinction between:
    - Power - the strength of desires - Plato's non-ration parts of the soul. Humean deliberation.
    - Authority - the rational weight of desires - Plato's rational parts of the soul. Non-humean deliberation.
- Butler revived Aristotelian view that human nature constitutes a system, rather than a collection of desires
- About indirect consequentialism:Butler suggests that in the context of reflexion—‘in a cool hour’, as he puts it—we can appropriately ask questions that ought not to intrude into immediate deliberation.
- Protests against the view that egoism is the only safe alternative to enthusiasm.
- Butler maintains the connexion asserted by Suarez about the relation of the immutability of morality and the naturalist account of moral properties
- Butler’s objection that utilitarianism allows unfair treatment of one person simply for the benefti of others.²⁵
- Clarke does not point out the possibility of deriving a principle of benevolence from the obligation to prudence combined with the obligation to equity.³⁹ If we rationally wish to promote our own interest, and we recognize that what is rational for us to want for ourselves is equally rational for others to want for themselves, an appeal to equity justifeis the extension of benevolence to everyone. Clarke’s explicit argument appeals to the principle of equity to justify universal benevolence, but he does not appeal to the rationality of prudence. This may be because he treats the principle of prudence as derivative from other duties, not as a rational principle in its own right. Here Butler improves on him.⁴⁰ 
- Clarke does not reject this naturalist account of the basis of moral obligations. In his discussion of benevolence and universal love, he frist offers an explanation that relies on the inherent fitness of seeking the greater good, but then, as we saw, he appeals to Stoic views on nature and conciliation.⁶⁷ These are naturalist views, and Clarke speaks here of the natural constitution and needs of human beings. He does not see that this account of moral obligations conflicts with his claims about the inherent fitness of certain actions. Butler contrasts a naturalist position with the a priori rationalism of Clarke. Butler’s naturalism is all the more plausible in the light of Clarke’s tendency to rely on it.⁶⁸  
- Butler believes Clarke goes too far in rejecting naturalism; the restoration of some aspects of traditional naturalism is Butler’s answer to sentimentalism. 
- If moral reasons are not derived from self-interest, they must provide suffciient reasons by themselves, without reference to any more ultimate reasons. Our recognition, for instance, that this action promotes the public good must provide—in conjunction with the relevant desire—a reason for doing it, without appeal to any further self-interested consideration. But a simple desire for the good of others for their own sake does not make someone morally good. Even if such a desire is entirely non-self-regarding, we could have it without approving of our action. It is characteristic of a morally good person, however, to approve of this desire, whether in himself or in someone else; that is the essentially reflexive element of morality. To make a moral judgment on an action is not simply to add another desire to our initial desire to do the action; it is to express the view that this desire is right and appropriate for an agent in these circumstances. A rationalist might accept these arguments. If promotion of the public good is a sufficient justification and admits no further justification, perhaps reason recognizes this justification.²⁷ Similarly, the reflexive character of moral judgment may result from rational recognition of the appropriate desire.²⁸ Butler and Reid agree with Hutcheson on the reflexive character of moral judgment. But they do not infer that moral judgments are not a product of reason.
- Butler’s sermons are intended ‘to explain what is meant by the nature of man, when it is said that virtue consists in following, and vice in deviating from it; and by explaining to show that the assertion is true’ (P13). He says that this claim about nature is the view of the ancient moralists; they believe that vice is ‘more contrary’ to human nature than torture and death are.¹ In the comparative ‘more contrary’ Butler suggests that torture and death are to some degree contrary to nature.² He therefore attributes to the ancients a doctrine of degrees of naturalness, and hence a graded conception of nature, according to which torture and death are indeed contrary to nature, but less contrary than vice is. These remarks about the ancients recall the Stoics, and especially passages in Cicero that assume a graded conception of nature.³ 
- A correct account of human nature, in Butler’s view, not only vindicates the truth and importance of Stoic naturalism, but also supports it against the three main rival positions that Butler considers: extreme rationalism, sentimentalism, and Hobbesian egoism 
- Many of Butler’s claims about nature might be taken to support a sentimentalist account of morality. In his first sermon he endorses Hutcheson’s claim that human nature includes not only self-interested but also moral attitudes. He mentions benevolence (i 6), particular passions (i 7), and reflexion (i 8). The principle of reflexion is the principle by which we approve or disapprove of our passions, propensions, and actions; and Butler identifies this principle with conscience.¹² He claims, then, that the sentimentalist is right about the extent of human motives, against Hobbes’s egoism.¹³ He disagrees about the character of our moral attitudes, rejecting Hutcheson’s view that they consist in a non-rational moral sense. But on other points we might suppose that he agrees with Hutcheson. It is not surprising that Hutcheson endorses some of Butler’s arguments, and in his later work takes the moral sense to incorporate some of the features of conscience, as Butler conceives it.¹⁴
- But despite these points of agreement with Hutcheson, Butler believes that the sentimentalists offer an inadequate conception of human nature. If human nature were simply a collection of the motives and dispositions recognized by sentimentalists, Hutcheson would be right.¹⁵ But Butler rejects this account of human nature.
- In Butler’s view, the sentimentalists are wrong to hold the view that the one who lacks a strong preference to bea virtuous also has no reason to be virtuous, because their account of human nature is incomplete.
- Butler’s naturalism implies that moral truths cannot be proved without reference to facts about human nature: He compares Clarke’s rationalism with his own naturalism.²⁰ He grants that the rationalist argument ‘seems the most direct formal proof, and in some respects the least liable to cavil and dispute’. The ‘seems’ and ‘in some respects’ mark possible reservations. If it were intuitively certain that, for instance, benefaction requires gratitude, that would indeed be a direct formal proof, and it would put the moral principle beyond cavil and dispute. But Clarke’s alleged proof of such principles does not seem convincing enough to exclude cavil and dispute.
- Butler distinguishes 3 senses of nature and netural:
    - in accordance with some natural impulse or other
    - in accordance with one’s strongest natural impulse. These two senses capture Hobbes’s appeals to nature. Hobbes looks for an account of human nature that identifeis the basic moving forces that explain all the varied and complex movements and tendencies of a human being. Morality, in his view, depends on facts about human nature, but it is not natural. Hutcheson’s naturalism also relies on these two senses of ‘natural’. In his view, virtue is natural because it is based on one of our natural sentiments, benevolence, and therefore excites the approval of the moral sense. Wollaston assumes the same sense of ‘natural’ in criticizing sentimentalist appeals to the natural. 
    - connexion between nature and system. The third sense of ‘natural’ relies on a teleological conception of a system and its needs. To apply this pattern directly to human beings, we have to assume that they are also artifacts designed for some purpose. Butler certainly believes that human beings are designed by God. We can say both:
        - that the nature of a watch is to tell the time. It is a claim about the system as a whole; its different bits and pieces constitute some organized whole in which they have a particular part to play
        - that it is natural for watches to run fast or slow, break down, etc. The second of these statements fits the first two senses of nature just described. But the first fits neither of them exactly. The watch goes against its nature when it is (as we say) ‘out of order’. 
- His ethical argument does not rely directly on the theological premiss about God and its design; and so he tries to explain his claims about nature and system without appeal to design.²⁹ 
- If we treat something as a system rather than simply a collection, we imply that its different traits achieve results that are not only consistent, but also harmonious and mutually co-operative. Consistency requires that different traits do not regularly conflict and do not undermine one another. Harmony requires them to co-exist in such a way that their results support one another. Co-operation requires more active steps to achieve harmony, so that one trait not only supports or facilitates another, but strengthens and helps it. In claiming that human beings have a nature, Butler claims that we constitute systems of this sort. We discover our nature by looking at a human being to see how the different elements constitute a single system. We grasp the system in human nature not by looking at the several passions and motives in themselves, but from considering their relations.³⁰ 
- To see that human nature is a system, we need to understand the role of superior principles in our action; this is the feature of human nature that sentimentalists have left out.³¹ - Butler claims that ‘reflexion’ or ‘conscience’ is a superior principle in human nature. If we simply treat it as one motive among others, we ignore its superiority. Even if we were to claim, falsely, that it is always or usually our dominant motive, we would not have recognized its superiority. We have to acknowledge a superior principle as having authority, and not simply strength.
- Butler introduces two claims about superior principles: (1) Human nature includes superior principles, those that rely on authority rather than strength. (2) Human nature is a system insofar as it is governed by superior principles. The second of these claims seems to go beyond the first. Since superiority does not imply greater strength, our motives might include superior principles that do not govern us, and we might be inclined to say that they ought not to govern us because they make our lives chaotic; the mere fact that they claim authority does not show that we ought to listen to their claim. But though these are two distinct claims about superior principles, Butler takes them to be closely connected;
he believes that once we understand what superior principles are, we also see that we act in accordance with our needs as whole systems only insofar as we act in accordance with superior principles.
Butler’s diagnosis of the error of the sentimentalists shows that his conclusion is not to be treated as an analytic truth; the meaning of ‘natural’ or ‘in accordance with our nature’ is not to be given by ‘in accordance with a superior principle’. Rather, when we understand the meaning of ‘in accordance with nature’ and of ‘superior principle’, we recognize the synthetic truth that acting on superior principles is in accordance with nature. To act in accordance with nature is to act in accord with the requirements of ourselves as whole systems. 




# Difficulties

- Rational deliberation may be either:
    - Eliminative:rational deliberation is impossible: there is nothing except experience of a siquence of inclinations and aversions. It does not explain the choices and actions it seeks to explain.
    - Greek Sceptic: rational deliberation is possible, but people are mistaken, because they lack the basis that they think it has - If Hobbes took this line, suggesting that we will abandon deliberation when we see it is baseless, he would undermine his argument to show that will is simply the last appetite in H-deliberation. If deliberation is not simply H-deliberation, will is not simply the last appetite.
