- Self-interest conflicts with interest of others
- Rejects the supremacy of reasons based on one’s own good for being moral
- argument Butler urges against Hobbes: the claim that we do everything as a means to our own satisfaction does not explain why we find our satisfaction where we do; contrary to the egoist view, our finding satisfaction in getting x presupposes a desire for x itself, which explains why we get the satisfaction in x rather than y.
- Holistic Naturalism (Human nature os a system of some tendencies of people. But not all tendencies are part of human nature) is true
- The Naturalism is true. Human functionis to be guided by practical reason
- In unself i sh concern A wants to do x for B, simply because B wants x done or because it would be better for B, not because A gains any further benef i t from doing x. A shows this concern for B if A moves to one side to avoid walking over B’s gouty toes, when A has nothing else to gain by doing this. This is the unself i sh sentiment whose reality Butler defend against the psychological egoism of Hobbes
- Butler distinguishes the respect in which illness and health are equally natural from the respect in which health is more natural than illness.
- Non-eudamonism moralism is true: happiness is not needed for a sufficient justification of virtue.
- Butler argues that the principle of self-love is not supreme, but is subordinate to conscience. Self-love and conscience are distinct superior principles, but conscience is supreme. He therefore denies that they are equally ultimate principles
- Rejects this primacy of self-love. 
- Butler says that the rational pursuit of happiness gives us the reason that impartial justice is even more rational that pursuit of happiness

- The distinction between:
    - Power - the strength of desires - Plato's non-ration parts of the soul. Humean deliberation.
    - Authority - the rational weight of desires - Plato's rational parts of the soul. Non-humean deliberation.
- Butler revived Aristotelian view that human nature constitutes a system, rather than a collection of desires
- About indirect consequentialism:Butler suggests that in the context of reflexion—‘in a cool hour’, as he puts it—we can appropriately ask questions that ought not to intrude into immediate deliberation.
- Protests against the view that egoism is the only safe alternative to enthusiasm.
- Butler maintains the connexion asserted by Suarez about the relation of the immutability of morality and the naturalist account of moral properties
- Butler’s objection that utilitarianism allows unfair treatment of one person simply for the benefti of others.²⁵










# Difficulties

- Rational deliberation may be either:
    - Eliminative:rational deliberation is impossible: there is nothing except experience of a siquence of inclinations and aversions. It does not explain the choices and actions it seeks to explain.
    - Greek Sceptic: rational deliberation is possible, but people are mistaken, because they lack the basis that they think it has - If Hobbes took this line, suggesting that we will abandon deliberation when we see it is baseless, he would undermine his argument to show that will is simply the last appetite in H-deliberation. If deliberation is not simply H-deliberation, will is not simply the last appetite.
