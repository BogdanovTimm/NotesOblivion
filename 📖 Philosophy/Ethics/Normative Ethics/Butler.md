- Self-interest conflicts with interest of others
- Rejects the supremacy of reasons based on one’s own good for being moral
- argument Butler urges against Hobbes: the claim that we do everything as a means to our own satisfaction does not explain why we find our satisfaction where we do; contrary to the egoist view, our finding satisfaction in getting x presupposes a desire for x itself, which explains why we get the satisfaction in x rather than y.
- Holistic Naturalism (Human nature os a system of some tendencies of people. But not all tendencies are part of human nature) is true
- The Naturalism is true. Human functionis to be guided by practical reason
- In unself i sh concern A wants to do x for B, simply because B wants x done or because it would be better for B, not because A gains any further benef i t from doing x. A shows this concern for B if A moves to one side to avoid walking over B’s gouty toes, when A has nothing else to gain by doing this. This is the unself i sh sentiment whose reality Butler defend against the psychological egoism of Hobbes
- Butler distinguishes the respect in which illness and health are equally natural from the respect in which health is more natural than illness.
- Non-eudamonism moralism is true: happiness is not needed for a sufficient justification of virtue.
- Butler argues that the principle of self-love is not supreme, but is subordinate to conscience. Self-love and conscience are distinct superior principles, but conscience is supreme. He therefore denies that they are equally ultimate principles
- Rejects this primacy of self-love. 
- Butler says that the rational pursuit of happiness gives us the reason that impartial justice is even more rational that pursuit of happiness
- Rejects eudaemonism
- The distinction between:
    - Power - the strength of desires - Plato's non-ration parts of the soul. Humean deliberation.
    - Authority - the rational weight of desires - Plato's rational parts of the soul. Non-humean deliberation.
- Butler revived Aristotelian view that human nature constitutes a system, rather than a collection of desires
- About indirect consequentialism:Butler suggests that in the context of reflexion—‘in a cool hour’, as he puts it—we can appropriately ask questions that ought not to intrude into immediate deliberation.
- Protests against the view that egoism is the only safe alternative to enthusiasm.
- Butler maintains the connexion asserted by Suarez about the relation of the immutability of morality and the naturalist account of moral properties
- Butler’s objection that utilitarianism allows unfair treatment of one person simply for the benefti of others.²⁵
- Clarke does not point out the possibility of deriving a principle of benevolence from the obligation to prudence combined with the obligation to equity.³⁹ If we rationally wish to promote our own interest, and we recognize that what is rational for us to want for ourselves is equally rational for others to want for themselves, an appeal to equity justifeis the extension of benevolence to everyone. Clarke’s explicit argument appeals to the principle of equity to justify universal benevolence, but he does not appeal to the rationality of prudence. This may be because he treats the principle of prudence as derivative from other duties, not as a rational principle in its own right. Here Butler improves on him.⁴⁰ 
- Clarke does not reject this naturalist account of the basis of moral obligations. In his discussion of benevolence and universal love, he frist offers an explanation that relies on the inherent fitness of seeking the greater good, but then, as we saw, he appeals to Stoic views on nature and conciliation.⁶⁷ These are naturalist views, and Clarke speaks here of the natural constitution and needs of human beings. He does not see that this account of moral obligations conflicts with his claims about the inherent fitness of certain actions. Butler contrasts a naturalist position with the a priori rationalism of Clarke. Butler’s naturalism is all the more plausible in the light of Clarke’s tendency to rely on it.⁶⁸  
- Butler believes Clarke goes too far in rejecting naturalism; the restoration of some aspects of traditional naturalism is Butler’s answer to sentimentalism. 
- If moral reasons are not derived from self-interest, they must provide suffciient reasons by themselves, without reference to any more ultimate reasons. Our recognition, for instance, that this action promotes the public good must provide—in conjunction with the relevant desire—a reason for doing it, without appeal to any further self-interested consideration. But a simple desire for the good of others for their own sake does not make someone morally good. Even if such a desire is entirely non-self-regarding, we could have it without approving of our action. It is characteristic of a morally good person, however, to approve of this desire, whether in himself or in someone else; that is the essentially reflexive element of morality. To make a moral judgment on an action is not simply to add another desire to our initial desire to do the action; it is to express the view that this desire is right and appropriate for an agent in these circumstances. A rationalist might accept these arguments. If promotion of the public good is a sufficient justification and admits no further justification, perhaps reason recognizes this justification.²⁷ Similarly, the reflexive character of moral judgment may result from rational recognition of the appropriate desire.²⁸ Butler and Reid agree with Hutcheson on the reflexive character of moral judgment. But they do not infer that moral judgments are not a product of reason.
- Butler’s sermons are intended ‘to explain what is meant by the nature of man, when it is said that virtue consists in following, and vice in deviating from it; and by explaining to show that the assertion is true’ (P13). He says that this claim about nature is the view of the ancient moralists; they believe that vice is ‘more contrary’ to human nature than torture and death are.¹ In the comparative ‘more contrary’ Butler suggests that torture and death are to some degree contrary to nature.² He therefore attributes to the ancients a doctrine of degrees of naturalness, and hence a graded conception of nature, according to which torture and death are indeed contrary to nature, but less contrary than vice is. These remarks about the ancients recall the Stoics, and especially passages in Cicero that assume a graded conception of nature.³ 
- A correct account of human nature, in Butler’s view, not only vindicates the truth and importance of Stoic naturalism, but also supports it against the three main rival positions that Butler considers: extreme rationalism, sentimentalism, and Hobbesian egoism 







# Difficulties

- Rational deliberation may be either:
    - Eliminative:rational deliberation is impossible: there is nothing except experience of a siquence of inclinations and aversions. It does not explain the choices and actions it seeks to explain.
    - Greek Sceptic: rational deliberation is possible, but people are mistaken, because they lack the basis that they think it has - If Hobbes took this line, suggesting that we will abandon deliberation when we see it is baseless, he would undermine his argument to show that will is simply the last appetite in H-deliberation. If deliberation is not simply H-deliberation, will is not simply the last appetite.
