- Virtue Rationalism (virtue = to be guided by practical reason) is true
- Extreme Will-Intellect-Passion Rationalism (thought without desire motivates) is true
- Clarke’s extreme intellectualism fits his foundationalist and intuitionist epistemology.
- Clarke’s belief in ‘eternal relations of fitness’. If such a view were right, then we could infer simply from the fact that A had benefited B that B ought to benefit A in return, without reference to the fact that A and B are rational agents in specific circumstances that affect their rational agency 
- Intuitionism is true: we can grasp principles of benevolence independently of grasping principles of justice. And they may conflict. Then, to resolve the conflict, we need third grasping of principles 
- According to rationalist critics, Hobbes is more deeply mistaken. Cudworth and Clarke attack all attempts to vindicate morality by reducing normative facts (i.e., facts about what we ought to do, and what we have reason to do) to non-normative psychological facts (about what we are in fact moved to do).
- he maintains a connexion between reason and morality
- oppose theological voluntarism. 
- In Clarke the belief in intrinsic morality is separated from naturalism,
- Clarke accepts Cudworth's going beyond Suarez: According to Suarez’s ‘intermediate’ position (as Suarez describes it), some aspects of natural law are independent of the divine legislative will and some depend on it. Natural law is law, and imposes an obligation, insofar as it depends on the divine will, whereas the rightness and wrongness of the acts that it prescribes and prohibits are features of the nature of things in themselves, apart from the divine will. Emphasis on one side or another of Suarez’s position results in a more strongly voluntarist or naturalist account. It is clearer that Cudworth goes beyond Suarez on this point, and reverts to Vasquez’s view that obligation, as well as duty, belongs to nature and not primarily to will.
- Sometimes, however, Leibniz’s principle of perfection seems rather similar to one of Clarke’s principles of fitness—as though it were intended as a principle that we can just see to be correct, without reference to our nature as rational agents. 
- Shaftesbury sketches a defence that is developed more fully, and with more specifci reference to orthodox Christianity, by Clarke and Balguy.⁵¹ 
- He addresses those who reject the Christian revelation because it cannot be vindicated by reason. In his view, the basic principles of morality are evident to reason, apart from any appeal to revelation, and these moral principles make it reasonable to believe in the Christianrevelation.Hissuccessdependsonrevealingtherationalgroundsof ‘theunalterable obligations of natural religion’, which we discover through our moral judgments. To reveal these grounds he defends some elements of a naturalist position against the view of those who claim ‘that there is no such real difference [sc. between good and evil] originally, necessarily, and absolutely in the nature of things’
- This description of Clarke’s argument suggests correctly that he supports Cudworth’s doctrine of eternal and immutable morality. He defends Cudworth’s position against the Hobbesian reduction of morality to counsels of narrow prudence and to positive law, and against the voluntarist explanation of morality as an expression of God’s legislative will. 
- Clarke departs from Cumberland, in rejecting both (1) a legislative conception of obligation, and (2) the identification of benevolence with morality.
- Clarke, however, does not defend all the aspects of Scholastic naturalism that Cudworth accepts. He goes beyond Cudworth in a rationalist direction. In his view, moral properties can be grasped by reason without any reference to human nature or human ends. In claiming that they are grasped by reason, he reaffrims the traditional naturalist view. But in claiming that a true description of the relevant facts need not refer to nature, he affirms rationalism without naturalism. His position lacks the teleological elements of Cudworth’s view and of Cudworth’s Scholastic and Stoic sources. Does Clarke’s non-naturalist rationalism present the best part of Cudworth freed from unhelpful accretions? Or does it leave out an important part of Cudworth’s view and thereby reach a less plausible view? 
- Clarke affirms that laws of nature are obligatory without reference to any divine command. He refers to Socrates’ argument against Euthyphro, and uses it against a voluntarist account of natural law. Following Cicero, he insists that natural law describes what is praiseworthy whether or not it is actually praised. Since actual praise does not determine the content of natural law, actual will cannot determine it either; hence it is not up to a human or a divine legislator to change what is right or wrong.⁹ 
- He does not even mention Cumberland’s view that without an imperative law mere amiability constitutes neither moral goodness nor obligation. He implicitly rejects Cumberland’s view that obligation lies in the act of the person imposing the obligation.
- He agrees with Cudworth, and with Maxwell’s criticism of Cumberland, in taking obligation to lie in facts about right and wrong apart from any act of obliging or any motive created in the person obliged.¹⁵ This is the extreme naturalist view of obligation, as Suarez understands it.
- This is the extreme naturalist view of obligation, as Suarez understands it. Vasquez accepts thisviewinclaimingthatthenaturallaw,understoodsimplyasobjectiverightnessandwrongness, implies obligation.¹⁶ Clarke follows Vasquez, in opposition to the voluntarist view of Culverwell, Locke, Cumberland, and Pufendorf, that both morality and obligation require imperative law. He does not explain why he prefers the extreme naturalist view to the moderate naturalist view of Suarez (and perhaps Grotius). Suarez argues that obligation depends on imperative law, but moral facts, properties, and duties (debita) depend only on natural facts. 
- Clarke agrees with Cudworth in treating ‘obligation’ as interchangeable with ‘duty’. In affirming a naturalist, as opposed to a voluntarist, position about morality and the divine will, he speaks indifferently of duty and obligation.¹⁷ Apart from all divine or human legislation, there is a difference between good and evil, and some things are more fti and appropriate than others. These naturally fit and good things include an obligation. To show that things have an obligatory power, nothing more needs to be shown, in Clarke’s view, than that they are good and reasonable and fit to be done in themselves.¹⁸ But if Clarke’s position is over-simplified, that does not seem to affect his main point. Despite his favourable references to Cumberland, he does not agree with Cumberland’s view that imposed obligation is necessary for morality. In affirming that obligation follows from facts about nature rather than will, he neither accepts nor rejects the substance of Suarez’s view of obligation, but he accepts the substance of the naturalist view of morality. 







#                  Difficulties

- Clarke and Balguy agree with Parker’s conception of happiness (His argument against Greek Moralists assumes a broadly hedonistic conception of happiness, which leads him to misunderstand the Stoic and the Aristotelian and Platonic position), and hence with his assertion that Greek moral philosophy cannot assure the appropriate connexion between virtue and happiness.⁴²
- he quotes Cumberland selectively, choosing a passage in which Cumberland denies that the natural law is arbitrary or mutable. Following Cumberland, Clarke asserts that God’s goodness constrains the scope of divine willing.¹¹ But he neither mentions nor discusses the voluntarism in Cumberland’s views on obligation.¹²
