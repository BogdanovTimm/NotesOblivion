- Virtue Rationalism (virtue = to be guided by practical reason) is true
- Extreme Will-Intellect-Passion Rationalism (thought without desire motivates) is true
- Clarke’s extreme intellectualism fits his foundationalist and intuitionist epistemology.
- Clarke’s belief in ‘eternal relations of fitness’. If such a view were right, then we could infer simply from the fact that A had benefited B that B ought to benefit A in return, without reference to the fact that A and B are rational agents in specific circumstances that affect their rational agency 
- Intuitionism is true: we can grasp principles of benevolence independently of grasping principles of justice. And they may conflict. Then, to resolve the conflict, we need third grasping of principles 
- According to rationalist critics, Hobbes is more deeply mistaken. Cudworth and Clarke attack all attempts to vindicate morality by reducing normative facts (i.e., facts about what we ought to do, and what we have reason to do) to non-normative psychological facts (about what we are in fact moved to do).
- he maintains a connexion between reason and morality
- oppose theological voluntarism. 
- In Clarke the belief in intrinsic morality is separated from naturalism,
- Clarke accepts Cudworth's going beyond Suarez: According to Suarez’s ‘intermediate’ position (as Suarez describes it), some aspects of natural law are independent of the divine legislative will and some depend on it. Natural law is law, and imposes an obligation, insofar as it depends on the divine will, whereas the rightness and wrongness of the acts that it prescribes and prohibits are features of the nature of things in themselves, apart from the divine will. Emphasis on one side or another of Suarez’s position results in a more strongly voluntarist or naturalist account. It is clearer that Cudworth goes beyond Suarez on this point, and reverts to Vasquez’s view that obligation, as well as duty, belongs to nature and not primarily to will.

- Clarke and Balguy agree with Parker’s conception of happiness (His argument against Greek Moralists assumes a broadly hedonistic conception of happiness, which leads him to misunderstand the Stoic and the Aristotelian and Platonic position), and hence with his assertion that Greek moral philosophy cannot assure the appropriate connexion between virtue and happiness.⁴²
