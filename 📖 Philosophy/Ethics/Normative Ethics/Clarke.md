- Virtue Rationalism (virtue = to be guided by practical reason) is true
- Extreme Will-Intellect-Passion Rationalism (thought without desire motivates) is true
- Clarke’s extreme intellectualism fits his foundationalist and intuitionist epistemology.
- Clarke’s belief in ‘eternal relations of fitness’. If such a view were right, then we could infer simply from the fact that A had benefited B that B ought to benefit A in return, without reference to the fact that A and B are rational agents in specific circumstances that affect their rational agency 
- Intuitionism is true: we can grasp principles of benevolence independently of grasping principles of justice. And they may conflict. Then, to resolve the conflict, we need third grasping of principles 
- According to rationalist critics, Hobbes is more deeply mistaken. Cudworth and Clarke attack all attempts to vindicate morality by reducing normative facts (i.e., facts about what we ought to do, and what we have reason to do) to non-normative psychological facts (about what we are in fact moved to do).
- he maintains a connexion between reason and morality
- oppose theological voluntarism. 
- In Clarke the belief in intrinsic morality is separated from naturalism,
- Clarke accepts Cudworth's going beyond Suarez: According to Suarez’s ‘intermediate’ position (as Suarez describes it), some aspects of natural law are independent of the divine legislative will and some depend on it. Natural law is law, and imposes an obligation, insofar as it depends on the divine will, whereas the rightness and wrongness of the acts that it prescribes and prohibits are features of the nature of things in themselves, apart from the divine will. Emphasis on one side or another of Suarez’s position results in a more strongly voluntarist or naturalist account. It is clearer that Cudworth goes beyond Suarez on this point, and reverts to Vasquez’s view that obligation, as well as duty, belongs to nature and not primarily to will.
- Sometimes, however, Leibniz’s principle of perfection seems rather similar to one of Clarke’s principles of fitness—as though it were intended as a principle that we can just see to be correct, without reference to our nature as rational agents. 
- Shaftesbury sketches a defence that is developed more fully, and with more specifci reference to orthodox Christianity, by Clarke and Balguy.⁵¹ 
- He addresses those who reject the Christian revelation because it cannot be vindicated by reason. In his view, the basic principles of morality are evident to reason, apart from any appeal to revelation, and these moral principles make it reasonable to believe in the Christianrevelation.Hissuccessdependsonrevealingtherationalgroundsof ‘theunalterable obligations of natural religion’, which we discover through our moral judgments. To reveal these grounds he defends some elements of a naturalist position against the view of those who claim ‘that there is no such real difference [sc. between good and evil] originally, necessarily, and absolutely in the nature of things’
- This description of Clarke’s argument suggests correctly that he supports Cudworth’s doctrine of eternal and immutable morality. He defends Cudworth’s position against the Hobbesian reduction of morality to counsels of narrow prudence and to positive law, and against the voluntarist explanation of morality as an expression of God’s legislative will. 
- Clarke departs from Cumberland, in rejecting both (1) a legislative conception of obligation, and (2) the identification of benevolence with morality.
- Clarke, however, does not defend all the aspects of Scholastic naturalism that Cudworth accepts. He goes beyond Cudworth in a rationalist direction. In his view, moral properties can be grasped by reason without any reference to human nature or human ends. In claiming that they are grasped by reason, he reaffrims the traditional naturalist view. But in claiming that a true description of the relevant facts need not refer to nature, he affirms rationalism without naturalism. His position lacks the teleological elements of Cudworth’s view and of Cudworth’s Scholastic and Stoic sources. Does Clarke’s non-naturalist rationalism present the best part of Cudworth freed from unhelpful accretions? Or does it leave out an important part of Cudworth’s view and thereby reach a less plausible view? 
- Clarke affirms that laws of nature are obligatory without reference to any divine command. He refers to Socrates’ argument against Euthyphro, and uses it against a voluntarist account of natural law. Following Cicero, he insists that natural law describes what is praiseworthy whether or not it is actually praised. Since actual praise does not determine the content of natural law, actual will cannot determine it either; hence it is not up to a human or a divine legislator to change what is right or wrong.⁹ 
- He does not even mention Cumberland’s view that without an imperative law mere amiability constitutes neither moral goodness nor obligation. He implicitly rejects Cumberland’s view that obligation lies in the act of the person imposing the obligation.
- He agrees with Cudworth, and with Maxwell’s criticism of Cumberland, in taking obligation to lie in facts about right and wrong apart from any act of obliging or any motive created in the person obliged.¹⁵ This is the extreme naturalist view of obligation, as Suarez understands it.
- This is the extreme naturalist view of obligation, as Suarez understands it. Vasquez accepts thisviewinclaimingthatthenaturallaw,understoodsimplyasobjectiverightnessandwrongness, implies obligation.¹⁶ Clarke follows Vasquez, in opposition to the voluntarist view of Culverwell, Locke, Cumberland, and Pufendorf, that both morality and obligation require imperative law. He does not explain why he prefers the extreme naturalist view to the moderate naturalist view of Suarez (and perhaps Grotius). Suarez argues that obligation depends on imperative law, but moral facts, properties, and duties (debita) depend only on natural facts. 
- Clarke agrees with Cudworth in treating ‘obligation’ as interchangeable with ‘duty’. In affirming a naturalist, as opposed to a voluntarist, position about morality and the divine will, he speaks indifferently of duty and obligation.¹⁷ Apart from all divine or human legislation, there is a difference between good and evil, and some things are more fti and appropriate than others. These naturally fit and good things include an obligation. To show that things have an obligatory power, nothing more needs to be shown, in Clarke’s view, than that they are good and reasonable and fit to be done in themselves.¹⁸ But if Clarke’s position is over-simplified, that does not seem to affect his main point. Despite his favourable references to Cumberland, he does not agree with Cumberland’s view that imposed obligation is necessary for morality. In affirming that obligation follows from facts about nature rather than will, he neither accepts nor rejects the substance of Suarez’s view of obligation, but he accepts the substance of the naturalist view of morality. 
- Clarke agrees with Cudworth in believing that the law of nature and the moral properties it involves are eternal and immutable. He takes these properties to be eternal and necessary fitnesses in things that result from their eternal and necessary relations.¹⁹ These eternal ftinesses are the grounds of obligations on us apart from any positive will or command of God. 
- Clarke offers a list of moral principles that embody fitnesses: 
    - Since God is infinitely superior to us, it is fit for us to honour, worship, obey, and imitate God. 
    - It is fit for God to govern the universe ‘according to constant and regular ends’ and to do what is best for the whole creation, rather than to design the misery of the whole. 
    - Similarly, in relations among human beings, benevolence is more fit than universal destructiveness;²⁰ 
    - it is more fit to treat one another justly than to consider only one’s own advantage; 
    - and more fit to preserve the life of an innocent person than to kill him or to let him die without any reason or provocation
- Clarke combines this claim about the source of eternal ftinesses with a claim about our knowledge of these ftinesses; he believes that they are perfectly evident to an unprejudiced subject. In speaking of what is clear ‘in the nature of the thing itself’, Clarke seems to mean that simple inspection of the relevant proposition convinces us of its truth. Someone who denies that there is light while he is looking at the sun fails to recognize something that is as obvious as anything could be.²¹ If someone entertains doubt on this point, it is pointless to argue with him, or to try to convince him on any question that depends on the evidence of the senses, just as there is no point in arguing about geometry with someone who rejects its basic assumptions.²² 
- It is not clear why judgments about what is fit in itself should have this degree of evidence. Perhaps Clarke is combining two conceptions of fitness ‘in itself’. (1) In saying that things are fit in themselves or in their own nature, he is opposing the view that their rightness depends on divine or human legislation or on their promotion of some further end—maximum utility, for instance. (2) But he also seems to mean that their rightness belongs to them entirely without reference to anything else; it resides simply in the character of an action, taken by itself. This second conception of ftiness may be interpreted so as to support Clarke’s epistemological claim. For if we grasp ‘the character of an action, taken by itself’ simply by grasping the concept of the action, anything that ‘flows from the essence’ follows necessarily from the concept. Hence, anyone who clearly grasps the concept of the relevant action thereby grasps what folws from its nature. 
- Clarke’s idea of intrinsic morality may be defended by appeal to Cudworth’s demand for eternal and immutable morality. If the rightness of sparing the life of an innocent person is immutable, it belongs to the action simply insofar as it is sparing the life of an innocent person. If it depended on some further facts about the agent or the beneficiary of the action, it could change from being right to wrong if these further facts changed; hence its rightness would not be immutable. If it is to be immutably right, the mere fact that it is sparing the life of an innocent person must be the sole and sufficient basis of its rightness. Though Cudworth does not connect immutability with the intrinsic character of an action in exactly Clarke’s terms, Clarke might intelligibly claim to capture Cudworth’s implicit position. 
- Clarke, therefore, agrees with Suarez and Cudworth insofar as he relies on claims about intrinsic morality, fitness to nature, and immutability, and explains these claims in opposition to a legislative conception of morality. He departs from them, however, in supposing that intrinsic and immutable morality is intrinsic to actions themselves, without reference to their relation to agents of a certain kind. 
- Teleology is present in Suarez’s naturalism no less than in Aquinas’ naturalism; hence, Suarez’s claims about morality as fitness to rational nature include a teleological element that is absent from Clarke’s claims about eternal fitnesses. Clarke offers no account of rational nature that might make it reasonable to claim that one or another action is fitting to rational nature.  Clarke, therefore, abandons Suarez’s naturalism.²⁴
- Fitness and contradiction, therefore, according to Suarez, are three-term relations, involving an action, an essence, and human nature. Being innocent and being deliberately killed are incompatible, because they do not fit the requirements of human nature, and in particular do not fit the social aspects of human nature, which require us to refrain from harming others (except in circumstances specifeid by the requirements of human nature). According to Clarke, the relevant relations have only two terms; they involve the action and the essence that it contradicts. Since a triangle essentially has angles adding up to 180 degrees, a triangle with angles adding up to 200 degrees contradicts this essence. Since an innocent person is one who has a right not to be killed, the rightness of deliberate killing of the innocent contradicts the essence of innocence. 
-  Passmore says (corectly) that in Clarke, what is eternal and immutable is a system of duties, not the goodness of a certain way of life.
-  The disappearance of the teleological element, and hence of the appeal to goodness that Passmore mentions, cannot be explained by Clarke’s acceptance of a legislative conception of obligation.  Instead, we need to appeal to his epistemology
- In contrast to Suarez and Cudworth, therefore, Clarke separates rationalism and objectivism from naturalism. He agrees with naturalism insofar as he rejects voluntarism and a legislative conception of moral rightness, and therefore accepts intrinsic morality. Moreover, he believes that intrinsic morality can be grasped by rational reflexion on the objective facts about agents and actions. But he seems to have a more restrictive conception of the facts and the refelxion that are relevant. He replaces deliberation about the goal-directed nature of rational agents with inspection of the inherent character of acts apart from their context and their ends.²⁷ 
- Some moral disputes might be settled by the means Clarke offers. If, for instance, we wonder whether murder is wrong, we might simply be forgetting that the concept of murder is the concept of an unjustifiable homicide. Moreover, significant and complex moral disputes might turn on conceptual issues—if answers to conceptual questions may be diffciult to fnid. Clarke’s particular understanding of conceptual issues, however, seems to ensure that the only truths he can offer about fitness will be trivial and uninformative. 
- In some of these cases we can perhaps see why Clarke thinks the denial of a basic principle involves a contradiction. Perhaps he thinks it is part of the concept of God that God deserves honour and obedience from creatures like us. Similarly, he might argue that if we both accept a duty and reject the necessary means to carrying out we do not really believe that it is a duty. But it is more difficult to find such an account of the principle of equity. If I want to harm others for my advantage and want them to benefit me for my advantage, my will does not contradict itself. To reach a contradiction in cases such as this one, we have to begin from a different starting point, drawing on Cumberland’s claims about the impartiality of practical reason.³³ If I claim that it is reasonable for me, as a rational agent, to treat other rational agents, as rational agents, without regard for their interests, but unreasonable for others, as rational agents, to treat me, as a rational agent, without regard for my interests, then I contradict myself. I begin from claims about how it is reasonable for one rational agent to treat another, but then I contradict these claims in different cases, even though I have already agreed that the principles apply to all rational agents. 
- Even if we agree with Clarke’s view that we necessarily accept some principle of equity, we might doubt whether it has any significant moral content. He does not explain how more specific moral principles might emerge from this impartial point of view. Some of his remarks, however, suggest that he intends to derive them from impartiality. He claims that the principle of equity requires us ‘so to deal with every man, as in like circumstances we would reasonably expect he should deal with us’ (H ii 619 = R 241). He does not say simply that we should treat others as we would prefer them to treat us; for our preferences may themselves be self-centred and warped. He requires us to take an impartial view of our own desires as well. 








#                  Difficulties

- Clarke and Balguy agree with Parker’s conception of happiness (His argument against Greek Moralists assumes a broadly hedonistic conception of happiness, which leads him to misunderstand the Stoic and the Aristotelian and Platonic position), and hence with his assertion that Greek moral philosophy cannot assure the appropriate connexion between virtue and happiness.⁴²
- he quotes Cumberland selectively, choosing a passage in which Cumberland denies that the natural law is arbitrary or mutable. Following Cumberland, Clarke asserts that God’s goodness constrains the scope of divine willing.¹¹ But he neither mentions nor discusses the voluntarism in Cumberland’s views on obligation.¹² 
- The teleological argument favoured by Aquinas and Suarez does not fit Clarke’s view that we ought to be able to see the rightness of benevolence simply by considering what it is. In their view, we must consider how benevolence fits into other aspects of human nature. We cannot simply consider benevolence by itself, but we must also consider its relation to human nature. 
- These three moralists explain claims about morality by appeal to some notion of contradiction, but they understand ‘contradiction’ in different ways that match their conceptions of fitness. Suarez explains the sense in which God would be making a contradiction true if he were to change moral rightness and wrongness. Given the facts about rational nature and the fact that, necessarily, right and wrong are what accords with and confilcts with rational nature, a change in right and wrong, without a corresponding change in human nature, would make it true that the same action both is and is not in accord with rational nature. To make the killing of innocent persons cease to be wrong is not contradictory in itself, but it leads to a contradiction, given the facts about rational nature, about killing, and about rightness.²⁵ Cudworth also speaks of contradiction, but he does not explain so clearly where the contradiction lies. Clarke resolves the obscurity in Cudworth, but he does not return to Suarez; he asserts a direct contradiction between the idea of killing an innocent person and the idea of moral rightness, similar to the contradiction between having angles adding up to 200 degrees and being a triangle. This version of an appeal to contradiction, as opposed to the naturalist version, is effectively criticized by Pufendorf.²⁶ 
- It is difficult to separate metaphysics from epistemology in Clarke’s conception of eternal fitnesses, and it is difficult to say which is prior to which. He seems to connect two controversial doctrines: (1) He explains the sort of contradiction and fitness relevant to naturalist ethical claims by appeal to logical and conceptual relations. (2) He explains our grasp of logical and conceptual relations by appeal to self-evidence and obviousness.²⁸ The frist move is disputable, but not surprising, since the appeal to contradiction can be clearly and intelligibly explained by reference to mathematical entities. The second move is initially appealing, since it seems to show that an opponent who denies claims about ftiness is simply failing to see something that should be obvious to any mind free of confusion. 
- But this apparent advantage of Clarke’s conception of fitness has severe costs. Three disadvantages are especially evident: 
    - Clarke makes it difficult to explain how there could ever be reasonable dispute or uncertainty about what is morally right. His explanation of fitness through immediacy makes it look as though moral disputes must always result from gross confusion or irrationality. The naturalist explanation of ftiness by appeal to nature at least shows why it might sometimes be difficult to answer moral questions. 
    - As Clarke understands the obvious, it seems rather uninformative. If we ask what is wrong with deliberately killing innocent people, Clarke seems to answer that the meaning of ‘innocent person’ includes a reference to the wrongness of deliberately killing them. Hence the answer to our question will be that it is wrong to kill an innocent person because an innocent is one whom it is wrong to kill. If we want to know why it is wrong to kill a person who has done us no wrong, Clarke’s appeal to the defniition of innocence does not answer our question. 
    - The appeal to obviousness suggests that the appeals to fitness and to nature are idle; the recognition of obviousness seems to provide all the explanation that Clarke takes to be available. 
- When Clarke replaces fitness to rational nature with bare fitness, it is difficult to see that a claim about fitness explains or justifies the claim that an action is morally right. Reference to fitness does not seem to introduce any further feature that might support the judgment about rightness. Clarke’s conception of fitness may lead us in the wrong direction, if we try to explain it through self-evidence. For the most plausible explanation of the self-evidence that he attributes to judgments of fitness treats them as purely conceptual judgments. We may well find that this is too restrictive a conception of moral judgment.
