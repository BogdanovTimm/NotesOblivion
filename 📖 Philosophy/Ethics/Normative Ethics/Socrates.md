- **Knowledge** of what is **good for me** is **sufficient for action**
- The **virtues** that **promote my good** are the **moral virtues**
- The **virtues** are **sufficient for happiness**
- **Good** = **Long-term pleasantness** that are both **remembered** and **anticipated**
- **Virtues** = **knowledge of** what brings **long-term pleasures** that are both **remembered** and **anticipated**
- **Virtues** have only **instrumental value** (not an ultimate one)
- **Reciprocity of the virtues** - each virtue requires each of the others
- **Unity of the virtues** - the **supposedly distinct virtues** constitute **one** and the same **virtue** (knowledge of long-term pleasantness)
- We **can't be wrong about** which **actions** are **virtuous**
- We **can't be wrong about** **number** and **types** of **virtues**
- It is the **fact** about human **psychology**, that people **know what is pleasant** for them
- It is the **fact** about human **psychology**, that people **evaluate long-term pleasant as good**
- He does not defines **Happiness**
- Tried to find :
    - how we may reduce moral properties to non-moral terms (epistemological condition). E.g.: justice is an Aethean Law
    - which property makes all X be X (explanatory demand). E.g.: justice is not an Aethian Law, because if Aethian Law changes - justice may stays same





#                  Weaknesses

- If remembering and anticipating pleasure is good - then, rational agency is better then pleasure => we can't be hedonists anymore









#                  Virtues

Socrates mentions:
- Bravery
- Justice
- Piety
- Temperance
- Wisdom


These are the only virtues that Socrates discusses in the earliest Platonic dialogues, though they are not the only traits generally recognized as virtues by his contemporaries (which is important, because he thought that we have direct knowledge of virtues)
