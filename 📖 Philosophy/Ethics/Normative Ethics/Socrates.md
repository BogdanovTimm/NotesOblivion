#                  Virtues

Socrates mentions:
- Bravery
- Justice
- Piety
- Temperance
- Wisdom


These are the only virtues that Socrates discusses in the earliest Platonic dialogues, though they are not the only traits generally recognized as virtues by his contemporaries (which is important, because he thought that we have direct knowledge of virtues)
