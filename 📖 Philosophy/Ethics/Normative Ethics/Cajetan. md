- Cajetan’s defence of Aquinas against Scotus rests on an apparently more controversial aspect of Aquinas’ doctrine. According to Cajetan, if we refrain from pursuing happiness ‘negatively’, we assume that our action fits our ultimate end, because we do not stop to consider the question; this is what happens in the thoughtless pleasures that are venial sins.If we choose contrary to our conception of happiness, Cajetan argues that we must actually have formed a different conception of our ultimate end, and a mistaken one. If we did not change our conception of happiness, we would desire the contrary of our full perfection, and such a desire is impossible.³¹ Cajetan’s answer to Scotus depends on his assumption that no one can desire the contrary of his full perfection.
