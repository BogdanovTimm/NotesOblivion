- Barbeyrac especially condemns Aristotle’s willingness to permit abortion in some circumstances

- Barbeyrac shares Pufendorf’s concern to distinguish natural law theory from Hobbes’s position. 
- Barbeyrac suggest that so much falsity is present in the Scholastics that it is not worth trying to extract the truth.

- Actually, Grotius does not introduce a jural conception of morality, but rejects a jural conception in favour of Scholastic naturalism. Nor does his belief that there would be morality even if God did not exist make him a secular moralist; since he shares this belief with leading Scholastics, he is no more secular on this point than they are. His reply to Carneades’ scepticism about justice does not reduce justice to utility, but sticks to a Stoic and Peripatetic naturalist conception.
