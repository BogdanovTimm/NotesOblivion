- Barbeyrac especially condemns Aristotle’s willingness to permit abortion in some circumstances
- Though he praises Hobbes, he also attacks him for treating self-interest as the only basis of society. In the Leviathan, according to Barbeyrac, Hobbes goes even further, making the sovereign the basis of morality and religion.
- Barbeyrac shares Pufendorf’s concern to distinguish natural law theory from Hobbes’s position. 
- Barbeyrac suggest that so much falsity is present in the Scholastics that it is not worth trying to extract the truth.
- we have found that Barbeyrac is right to deny that the jural conception is the Scholastic conception.

- Actually, Grotius does not introduce a jural conception of morality, but rejects a jural conception in favour of Scholastic naturalism. Nor does his belief that there would be morality even if God did not exist make him a secular moralist; since he shares this belief with leading Scholastics, he is no more secular on this point than they are. His reply to Carneades’ scepticism about justice does not reduce justice to utility, but sticks to a Stoic and Peripatetic naturalist conception. 
- perhaps Pufendorf and Barbeyrac do not mean this. Perhaps they mean that the content of the natural law is fixed independently of God’s legislative will, but its character as morality depends on God’s legislation. This legislation, however, is necessary; it is not an exercise of God’s free will. The attempt to replace arbitrary will with necessary will raises further objections. For Barbeyrac cannot say that God’s choice of laws aimed at natural goods is necessary because God necessarily chooses the right; for if he said that, he would admit that right is independent of God’s choice, and so he would concede the whole point to Leibniz. But if it is a mere psychological necessity, not based in rational necessity, it does not seem less arbitrary in the relevant sense. Barbeyrac’s defence of Pufendorf on this point is therefore open to question. He is right to accuse Leibniz of not taking account of everything that Pufendorf says and of oversimplifying his position in ways that make it easier to refute with well-worn anti-voluntarist arguments. As Barbeyrac sees, Pufendorf modifies the voluntarist position in ways that escape criticisms that apply to Ockhamist voluntarism. But these modifications do not result in a defensible alternative to Leibniz’s naturalism. Either they collapse into naturalism or they are open to a modified version of the naturalist objections to Ockham. 
- Pufendorf has a way out of this objection only if the ‘just cause’ for God’s rule is non-moral. This may be what he has in mind; if we deny that God’s superiority rests simply on superior force, a moral basis is not the only alternative. We may also recognize someone as superior out of gratitude, love, admiration, or reverence, none of which necessarily rests on recognition of moral rightness. Leibniz’s objection, then, is too simple. But it may nonetheless be basically correct. For the non-moral attitudes that we have mentioned do not seem to provide a suffciient basis to show that God is an appropriate moral authority, or that his will could produce moral rightness. To be moved to obey someone out of gratitude, admiration, and so on is not to have any basis for believing that their commands will be morally right; and action exclusively from such motives is not the action of a morally virtuous person. 
- Barbeyrac not only defends Pufendorf against Leibniz’s attack, but also attacks the point of view from which Leibniz criticizes Pufendorf. Part of his defence of voluntarism relies on his arguments to show that naturalists cannot capture the distinctive features of morality. He believes that naturalists who take nature without divine legislation to be sufficient for morality hold an impoverished conception of morality. Since divine legislation introduces the morally right (honestum), a naturalist must reduce everything to pleasure and advantage. To show that Leibniz does this, Barbeyrac attacks his eudaemonism. Barbeyrac over-simplifeis the questions about eudaemonism. Both Aquinas and Suarez deny his assumption that eudaemonism subordinates everything to one’s own advantage and pleasure; for they regard the right (honestum) as distinct from the advantageous (commodum), but regard both as promoting the agent’s ultimate good. In overlooking this feature of the eudaemonist position, Barbeyrac weakens his defence of Pufendorf against the objections of Leibniz. Though Leibniz, as we have seen, tends to represent his eudaemonism as though it were hedonism, he does not consistently do this; and if he did, he would misrepresent the possibilities open to a eudaemonist. Like many others, Barbeyrac fails to acknowledge that traditional eudaemonists claim to distinguish the right and the advantageous without abandoning eudaemonism.⁴²
- According to Barbeyrac, the wise pagans, in contrast to Leibniz, recognized the honestum as distinct from the advantageous. How did they do this? Barbeyrac and Pufendorf believe that the distinctive feature of moral goodness is its dependence on a divine command. If, then, the wise pagans recognized moral goodness, must they not have recognized the dependence of morality on laws and divine commands?⁴³ But this was not part of their conception of morality. If Pufendorf is right, then Barbeyrac is wrong to allow that the wise pagans recognized the honestum. 
- His claim is nonetheless plausible; perhaps he simply means that when the ancients speak of the honestum, they recognized reason independent of considerations of one’s own interest. But if this is what it takes to recognize the honestum, divine commands do not seem to be necessary for morality. Barbeyrac’s praise of the wise pagans conflicts with his acceptance of Pufendorf’s necessary conditions for morality; he would be well advised to abandon Pufendorf’s view. 
- Barbeyrac might argue that the alleged obligation existing in the nature of things does not constitute a genuine obligation until we impose it on ourselves; for until we do that, it has no influence on our actions, and obligation implies some sort of motivation. But this internalist assumption about obligation and motivation undermines Barbeyrac’s claims no less than it undermines naturalist claims. If he accepts internalism, must he not say that our recognition of the will of God, rather than the will of God itself, imposes the obligation on us? If he refuses to say this, and distinguishes—quite reasonably—the existence of the obligation itself from our recognition of it, he should allow the same distinction to the naturalist. 
- Barbeyrac, however, takes the appearance of disagreement to be misleading. He suggests that Grotius’ really wants to say that even if there were no God and no divine legislation, things would still be naturally good and bad.¹ Grotius (as Barbeyrac interprets him) exaggerates this correct claim by asserting that without divine legislation there would be moral facts (iustum, ius, honestum, turpe), but this is an exaggeration of his main point that there would still be prudential facts. If Barbeyrac were right to say that Grotius really means only that there would be prudential facts without divine legislation, and does not really believe there would also be moral facts, he would indeed have reconciled Grotius’ view with Pufendorf’s voluntarism. But he gives us no reason to believe that Grotius does not mean what he says.
