- Barbeyrac especially condemns Aristotle’s willingness to permit abortion in some circumstances
- Though he praises Hobbes, he also attacks him for treating self-interest as the only basis of society. In the Leviathan, according to Barbeyrac, Hobbes goes even further, making the sovereign the basis of morality and religion.
- Barbeyrac shares Pufendorf’s concern to distinguish natural law theory from Hobbes’s position. 
- Barbeyrac suggest that so much falsity is present in the Scholastics that it is not worth trying to extract the truth.

- Actually, Grotius does not introduce a jural conception of morality, but rejects a jural conception in favour of Scholastic naturalism. Nor does his belief that there would be morality even if God did not exist make him a secular moralist; since he shares this belief with leading Scholastics, he is no more secular on this point than they are. His reply to Carneades’ scepticism about justice does not reduce justice to utility, but sticks to a Stoic and Peripatetic naturalist conception. 
- perhaps Pufendorf and Barbeyrac do not mean this. Perhaps they mean that the content of the natural law is fixed independently of God’s legislative will, but its character as morality depends on God’s legislation. This legislation, however, is necessary; it is not an exercise of God’s free will. The attempt to replace arbitrary will with necessary will raises further objections. For Barbeyrac cannot say that God’s choice of laws aimed at natural goods is necessary because God necessarily chooses the right; for if he said that, he would admit that right is independent of God’s choice, and so he would concede the whole point to Leibniz. But if it is a mere psychological necessity, not based in rational necessity, it does not seem less arbitrary in the relevant sense. Barbeyrac’s defence of Pufendorf on this point is therefore open to question. He is right to accuse Leibniz of not taking account of everything that Pufendorf says and of oversimplifying his position in ways that make it easier to refute with well-worn anti-voluntarist arguments. As Barbeyrac sees, Pufendorf modifies the voluntarist position in ways that escape criticisms that apply to Ockhamist voluntarism. But these modifications do not result in a defensible alternative to Leibniz’s naturalism. Either they collapse into naturalism or they are open to a modified version of the naturalist objections to Ockham. 
- Pufendorf has a way out of this objection only if the ‘just cause’ for God’s rule is non-moral. This may be what he has in mind; if we deny that God’s superiority rests simply on superior force, a moral basis is not the only alternative. We may also recognize someone as superior out of gratitude, love, admiration, or reverence, none of which necessarily rests on recognition of moral rightness. Leibniz’s objection, then, is too simple. But it may nonetheless be basically correct. For the non-moral attitudes that we have mentioned do not seem to provide a suffciient basis to show that God is an appropriate moral authority, or that his will could produce moral rightness. To be moved to obey someone out of gratitude, admiration, and so on is not to have any basis for believing that their commands will be morally right; and action exclusively from such motives is not the action of a morally virtuous person.
