- He is natural law moralist
- Morality depends on natural law, and hence on Divine commands, and that the natural foundation of morality consists in natural, but non-moral, goodness and badness.
- He critiques Hobbes
- He thinks that Grotius argued from effect to the cause, appealing to the shared sentiments of different people at different times to establish the existence of natural law
- We will find that the laws of nature are those principles that promote thegreatest common goodofrational beings, andthat they aresupportedby divinesanctions.
- Cumberland intends his account of the laws of nature to refute Hobbes. He especially attacks Hobbes’s account of human nature, of the state of nature as a state of war, and of natural right. At these points Hobbes reveals his basic errors about the content and aim of the laws of nature, and about our reason for following them. Cumberland argues against Hobbes that the laws of nature are not basically counsels of self-preservation, to be justified by their role in preserving the peace of the commonwealth and keeping us out of the state of nature. According to Cumberland, the laws of nature aim at the common good of rational agents, and this aim by itself makes it reasonable for rational agents to observe them.
- On the one hand, he rejects intrinsic morality; like Culverwell, he argues that morality and obligation come together and both require law. On the other hand, he does not agree with Hobbes and Pufendorf in supposing that the non-moral natural goods are simply those that promote one’s own advantage. 
- Though he praises Grotius’ treatment of natural law (Introd. §1), he takes a voluntarist position, which Pufendorf cites in his support.⁵ He accepts Suarez’s strict understanding of ‘law’ (without mentioning Suarez), and criticizes those who speak of the laws of nature loosely, without deriving them from the will of a legislator. He agrees with Selden’s view that if laws of nature were simply rational precepts, they would lack the authority that belongs to law.⁶ Laws are ‘practical propositions, with rewards and punishments annexed, promulged by competent authority’ (Introd. §6 = P 253). To show that there are laws of nature, therefore, is not simply to show that there are rational moral principles, but to show also that they are the work of a legislator who imposes sanctions.⁷
- Cumberland distinguishes two elements of a law of nature. The ‘precept’ gives the content of a natural law, indicating the particular way in which it aims at the common good of rational beings. The sanction consists of the reward God assigns to observance of the law, or the punishment God assigns to the violation.
The ‘sanction’ that Cumberland has in mind is not confined to rewards and punishments that God artificially attaches to good and bad conduct, by (for instance) rewarding good conduct with temporal prosperity in this life (as the Psalmists suppose) or with happiness in the afterlife. The relevant sanction also includes the natural and essential contribution of virtue to our own well-being.⁸ The fact that, as the ancient moralists claim, virtue promotes happiness appears to Cumberland to support his claim that God attaches a sanction to good and bad conduct. He does not believe that we must regard natural law as divine law if we are to recognize that sanctions are attached to it. In recognizing it as divine law we recognize that the connexion between virtue and happiness is the result of God’s intention to impose this law on us. If we left God aside, we could not justifiably treat the natural law as genuine law, but we would still have good reason to obey it because of its natural sanction.
