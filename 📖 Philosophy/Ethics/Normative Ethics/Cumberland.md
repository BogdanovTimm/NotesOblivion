- He is natural law moralist
- Morality depends on natural law, and hence on Divine commands, and that the natural foundation of morality consists in natural, but non-moral, goodness and badness.
- He critiques Hobbes
- He thinks that Grotius argued from effect to the cause, appealing to the shared sentiments of different people at different times to establish the existence of natural law
- We will find that the laws of nature are those principles that promote thegreatest common goodofrational beings, andthat they aresupportedby divinesanctions.
- Cumberland intends his account of the laws of nature to refute Hobbes. He especially attacks Hobbes’s account of human nature, of the state of nature as a state of war, and of natural right. At these points Hobbes reveals his basic errors about the content and aim of the laws of nature, and about our reason for following them. Cumberland argues against Hobbes that the laws of nature are not basically counsels of self-preservation, to be justified by their role in preserving the peace of the commonwealth and keeping us out of the state of nature. According to Cumberland, the laws of nature aim at the common good of rational agents, and this aim by itself makes it reasonable for rational agents to observe them.
- On the one hand, he rejects intrinsic morality; like Culverwell, he argues that morality and obligation come together and both require law. On the other hand, he does not agree with Hobbes and Pufendorf in supposing that the non-moral natural goods are simply those that promote one’s own advantage. 
- Though he praises Grotius’ treatment of natural law (Introd. §1), he takes a voluntarist position, which Pufendorf cites in his support.⁵ He accepts Suarez’s strict understanding of ‘law’ (without mentioning Suarez), and criticizes those who speak of the laws of nature loosely, without deriving them from the will of a legislator. He agrees with Selden’s view that if laws of nature were simply rational precepts, they would lack the authority that belongs to law.⁶ Laws are ‘practical propositions, with rewards and punishments annexed, promulged by competent authority’ (Introd. §6 = P 253). To show that there are laws of nature, therefore, is not simply to show that there are rational moral principles, but to show also that they are the work of a legislator who imposes sanctions.⁷
- Cumberland distinguishes two elements of a law of nature. The ‘precept’ gives the content of a natural law, indicating the particular way in which it aims at the common good of rational beings. The sanction consists of the reward God assigns to observance of the law, or the punishment God assigns to the violation.
The ‘sanction’ that Cumberland has in mind is not confined to rewards and punishments that God artificially attaches to good and bad conduct, by (for instance) rewarding good conduct with temporal prosperity in this life (as the Psalmists suppose) or with happiness in the afterlife. The relevant sanction also includes the natural and essential contribution of virtue to our own well-being.⁸ The fact that, as the ancient moralists claim, virtue promotes happiness appears to Cumberland to support his claim that God attaches a sanction to good and bad conduct. He does not believe that we must regard natural law as divine law if we are to recognize that sanctions are attached to it. In recognizing it as divine law we recognize that the connexion between virtue and happiness is the result of God’s intention to impose this law on us. If we left God aside, we could not justifiably treat the natural law as genuine law, but we would still have good reason to obey it because of its natural sanction. 
- Contrary to Hobbes, Cumberland takes the laws of nature to be prescriptions about the common good of rational beings. They achieve the good of an individual rational being insofar as her good is a part of the common good. Hence observance of the uni-versal law of nature promotes the good of each individual who is part of the whole.⁹ This does not imply that in any given society the good of the whole coincides with the good of each part; for in a defective community, no less than in a diseased or injured body, the good of the whole may involve some harm to a particular part.¹⁰
- This description of natural law agrees with Suarez’s claim that natural law is genuine law, and hence requires a legislator. Cumberland also follows Suarez in taking obligation to require legislation. He rejects Hobbes’s view that ‘obligation’ is properly applied to the mental state of the person obliged. He applies it to the imposer of the obligation, and therefore takes the divine will and command to oblige.¹² If he is right to claim that the natural law essentially carries obligation, and that obligation involves command, he is right to infer that the natural law requires divine legislation.
- He finds talk of ‘agreement’ obscure until it is explained by reference to the preservation and perfection of the subject with which an action ‘agrees’. But then, after excplanation, he agrees with those who say that natural law prescribes actions that fit human nature.
- In recognizing this natural good antecedent to legislation, Cumberland agrees with Suarez. But he rejects Suarez’s further claim that this natural good is sufficient for morality. In his view, the moral good requires legislation.¹⁵
- He concedes to Culverwell that the perfection of natural goods gives us an intrinsic reason (antecedent to any divine legislation) to pursue them, but he denies that this is honestas or morality.¹⁶ 
- This division between the natural and the moral good affects Cumberland’s explanation of his account of the natural law. When the natural law is defnied as aiming at the common good, ‘good’ refers to purely natural good, not to the moral good. To understand it as referring to the moral good would be to introduce a vicious circle, since moral good has to be defnied by reference to natural law.¹⁷ Only non-moral goods constitute the common good of rational agents. Morally right actions, therefore, should be understood teleologically and instrumentally, as means to non-moral goods.¹⁸ 
- Cumberland does not consider Suarez’s view that natural goods are sufficient for intrinsic morality that is antecedent to law. According to Suarez, natural law is just because it corresponds to intrinsic morality, but Cumberland implicitly rejects that view. Perhaps he agrees with Culverwell’s view that the distinctive features of moral obligation require law, or perhaps he agrees with Suarez’s view that obligation in general requires law. But he does not confront Suarez’s reasons for distinguishing the duties (debita) of intrinsic morality from obligations, which depend on law. 
- He recognizes that the ancient moralists are eudaemonists, who take the ultimate end to be the agent’s happiness. But he does not confuse their eudaemonism with hedonism, and he rejects hedonism. He takes activity and pleasure to be inseparably connected, and both to be necessary for happiness. Happiness is ‘a certain aggregate, whose parts we are continually enjoying’
- Virtue is necessary for happinessЮ
- He agrees with the ancient moralists who take virtue to be necessary for happiness.²⁰ Among these he agrees with those who take virtue to be a component of happiness, not merely a means to it. But he rejects the Stoic view that virtue is the only good; he endorses Cicero’s argument²¹ that the Stoic view takes away the point of virtuous action by denying that the effects it aims at are good.²² 
- Though Cumberland agrees with these aspects of Greek eudaemonism, he is not a eudaemonist, since he does not agree that one’s own happiness is or ought to be one’s supreme end.²³ His reason for rejecting eudaemonism is not that he believes in a conflict between one’s own good and the common good; on the contrary, he believes that one promotes one’s own good by advancing the common good of which it is a part.²⁴ But he does not believe that the justifying reason for pursuit of the common good depends entirely on its connexion with one’s own good. In his view, it is independently reasonable to pursue the common good, and it would be unreasonable to follow some rule that does not aim at everyone’s happiness. Even apart from any reference to the will of God, it is unreasonable to claim to be rationally justified in dominating others while admitting that they have an equally good reason for dominating oneself.²⁵ 
- Since they can all reasonably agree on this end, it is the end that rational beings, as such, must pursue.²⁶ The ‘sanction’ of the natural law does not consist simply in its promotion of my private interest. A further ‘reward’ is the fact that the moral law promotes the common good.
- he makes it clear that he believes in two irreducibly different aims of practical reason.²⁸ 
- Cumberland’s view of practical reason assumes that some natural goods are both non-instrumental and non-hedonic. These include the virtues of character recognized by the Greek moralists (Though they have moral goodness only because of this relation to a divine command. ).²⁹ He therefore rejects the view of Hobbes and Locke, that the only natural goods are the pleasant (iucundum) and the advantageous (utile). But he disagrees with Suarez’s view that the morally right (honestum) is one of the natural goods. In Cumberland’s view, the natural goods that are good in their own nature also promote the common good, and may be pursued for the sake of the common good, apart from any law. But these goods cannot be the source of an obligation or a duty (debitum), and so cannot be honesta, without reference to a law. Hence he rejects Suarez’s belief in natural duties prior to obligation and law. 
- he rejects Hobbes’s claims about the right of nature. He argues that the exercise of a Hobbesian right to do what I please in the state of nature would violate the demands of practical reason, and therefore go beyond my rights.³²

- He might claim that if the common end is the common good, including each person’s individual good, we can and should all agree to pursue it, because it is non-competitive. But we might still doubt whether this is so. Perhaps we can agree on pursuit of a common good, because we all hope to get our own good out of it; but it does not immediately follow that I have as good a reason to pursue the common good for its own sake as I have to pursue my own good. 
- According to Cumberland, the promotion of non-moral goodness is the whole of morality, if it is prescribed by divine law. But this account still reduces morality to an instrumental status.⁴⁰ Cum-
berland claims that moral principles are commanded by God simply as means to the public good; but this account of moral obligation makes it a purely prudential, not a moral, bond.
