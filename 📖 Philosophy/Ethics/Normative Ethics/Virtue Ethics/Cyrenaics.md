- Tgere are 2 affections: pain (a rough motion) and pleasure (a smooth motion)
- One pleasure is not different from another, nor is one at all pleasanter than another. 
- One affection is welcome, and the other repellent, to all animals
- bodily pleasure that they take to be the end is not the static pleasure following on the removal of pains â€” a sort of undisturbed condition, which Epicurus accepts and takes to be the end
