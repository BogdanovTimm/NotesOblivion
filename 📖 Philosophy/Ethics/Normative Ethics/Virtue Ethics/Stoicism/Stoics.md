- Reciprocity of the virtues - each virtue requires each of the others
- Virtues not only necessary for happiness, but also are sufficient for happiness
- Excercizing Wisdom (Rational Control) = Happiness
- Rational Control is non-Instrumentally Good
- Virtue = Rational Control => Virtue is non-Instrumentally Good.
- Knowledge is sufficient for acting
- The Naturalism is true. Human functionis to be guided by practical reason
- Concept of assent
- We will accept some priority in justif i cation if we take virtuous actions to be justif i ed primarily as the product of virtues, and do not take virtues to be justif i ed primarily as the source of virtuous actions. But this claim about priority seems to be open to objection. If we have no independent reason to care about the actions resulting from the virtues, but we claim that the virtues are organized for the production of these actions, what reason have we to value the virtues? Critics of the Stoics often raise this objection
- Pain is not bad at all
- Stoics, like Skeptics, value tranquillity, but while Skeptics say that every tranquillity is happiness, stoics think that only proper tranquillity, achieved by a proper way, is the happiness
- Criticise Skeptics: When they say that the Sceptic will be inactive, they do not mean that he will be immobile, or that he will lack goal-directed behaviour. They mean that his goal-directed behaviour will not be rational action.
- Determinism is true. In one of the Stoics’ examples, the action of felling the oak on Mount Pelion is suff i cient, in a deterministic universe, for Medea’s killing of her children.
- They are compatibilist aka soft determinists - determinism is compatible with free will
- They criticise Epicurus' argument against determinism by claiming that causes are more complex
- The growth of non-instrumental concern for practical reason is a result of the instrumental use of practical reason
- The three major Stoics are Zeno, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus
- Still, even though health is not good and illness is not bad, we have good reason to try to be healthy rather than ill. That is why health is a ‘preferred’ indifferent, and illness is a ‘non-preferred’ indifferent.
- The Stoics recognize an ultimate end for rational action, and they follow Aristotle in identifying the end with happiness.¹¹ They also agree with Aristotle in taking happiness to include all and only genuine goods; for they take their claim that ‘only the f i ne is good’ to be equivalent to the claim that virtue is self-suff i cient for happiness
- They do not endorse the extreme moralist view that the requirements of moral virtue and of rightness require agents to act against their happiness or to act without regard to their happiness
- They emphasize the coherence and connexion in their philosophy as a whole
- Prwffered indifferences = external goods
- The Stoics believe that the universe is governed by a divine providential intelligence, aiming at the good of the whole and of each part.
- The Stoics believe that in promoting the good of the whole we promote our own good
- My thought: for Stoics, only actions that are in your controll are the one that matters
- Nothing can harm virtuous man
- Even before agents are guided by explicit preconceptions, their desires are more than a collection of impulses aimed at unconnected satisfactions. They are linked by a common concern for the agent as a whole, conceived as a continuing self. Though the Stoics agree that agents without explicit reason have no explicit conception of themselves as continuing agents, a non-explicit conception of themselves explains the system and co-ordination in their desires. Once we see this system, we cannot suppose that the pleasure of satisfying particular desires is all that they care about for its own sake.
- At an early stage, human beings are like other animals; their appearances include an attractive element, so that if something appears pleasant (etc.), it thereby excites impulse and produces action. Later, however, we acquire the capacity to assent to our appearances and to dissent from them. Our appearances do not change their character; the things that appeared pleasant still appear pleasant, and are therefore still attractive, but we no longer follow them without question. We do not follow them until we assent. Assent is not simply a further appearance directed to the initial appearance. If we formed a tendency to accept or to welcome some appearances and to reject others, we would have what Hume calls a ‘lively idea’. But this is not what the Stoics identify with assent. They argue that whereas appearance is passive, and depends on the environment, assent is active. Appearance is involuntary, and assent is voluntary and depends on our judgment. Assent implies ‘conviction’ or ‘persuasion, which the Sceptic avoids.
- When we begin to assent, we are used to having appearances that have moved us to action by themselves.
These same appearances are still strongly suggestive, and we tend to assent to them.⁴⁹ This sort of assent ‘yields’ to appearances (Plu. SR 1056f = LS 41E; 1057a = LS 53S), and results in an ‘affection’ or ‘passion’ (pathos). A passion is an ‘immediate’ or ‘fresh’ assent that consists in yielding to an appearance that some natural advantage or disadvantage is good or evil.⁵⁰ In immediate assents we yield to our first appearances of how things are. Sometimes we yield immediately because the appearance comes on us suddenly and without preparation.
- In saying that we yield to appearances, the Stoics seek to explain and to correct the common assumption that the passions are ways of being affected rather than ways of acting.
They do not accept this assumption, since they identify a passion with an immediate assent, and all assent is active. Neither animals nor young children have passions,⁵³ because they act on appearance alone, whereas rational agents act on appearance only after assenting to it. When we act on passion, we act on minimal assent, since we fail to interfere with or to question the suggestion that the appearance makes.
By insisting that passion involves assent, the Stoics implicitly deny that we can act on our passions against all our beliefs.⁵⁴ If we seem to act against our beliefs, we really have wavering or oscillating beliefs; though we act against some of our beliefs, we act on other beliefs.⁵⁵ Similarly, passions cannot persist without the relevant beliefs about good and bad.⁵⁶ The passions that the Stoics identify with immediate assents include anger, fear, lust, and all the others that Plato and Aristotle ascribe to the non-rational parts of the soul.
- The Stoics argue that passions belong to the rational part of Platonic trinite soul, because they all assent to the action as good overall.
- Where common sense thinks it sees a conf l ict between rational assent and passion, the Stoics see wavering and vacillation between two conf l icting rational assents resting on conf l icting beliefs about what is best.
- Some sources quote passages in which Chrysippus seems to recognize the non-rational character of (for instance) anger, and our tendency to persist in it even when we recognize that we ought not to.⁵⁸
- Chrysippus believes that he can both recognize the apparently non-rational character of passions and still maintain his analysis of them as assents. In his view, the non-rational aspect of the passion is present in the appearance that underlies it. The suggestiveness of the appearance—the feature of it that makes it easy for us to yield to it in our assent—is a product of our experience, and (in many cases) of our upbringing and our interaction with other people. Plato and Aristotle are right, therefore, to say that passions are sometimes diff i cult to resist, but they are wrong about what resistance involves, and about what happens when we fail to resist them.
- In their view, the allegedly incontinent action in these cases is action on assent, since it is a voluntary action; and if it is an action on assent, the agent judges that the action is best, all things considered. This description of incontinence seems to differ sharply from Aristotle’s conception of incontinence as failure to follow my rational judgment of what is better on the whole. But Aristotle concedes a point to the Stoics; for he does not think it is possible to know that x is rationally preferable to y and, at the same time as one knows this, to choose and to do y rather than x. Incontinent people, in his view, lose their grasp of the true principles whenever they act incontinently. (EN 1147b9–17). In admitting that ignorance must be part of any explanation of incontinence, Aristotle seems to accept the central Stoic claim.
- If I assent unwisely to an appearance, I am hasty or careless in assuming that the weight of evidence favours its truth.
In these cases, my assent to the appearance rests on a judgment about its relation to my other beliefs about available evidence.
- Even impulsive people assent when they yield to their appearances; their outlook and values inf l uence the sorts of appearances that they will give way to, even though they do not usually attend explicitly or ref l ectively to the relevant considerations. The mere fact that the appearance suggests that revenge (for instance) is good does not explain why we seek revenge; for not all agents who have appearances suggesting this also yield to the appearance. Whether or not we yield to the appearance also depends on our more general and ref l ective values; if they permit us to yield to this sort of appearance, then we yield to it, and otherwise we do not yield to it.
- Their theory embraces compatibilism and soft determinism. They accept causal determinism for reasons connected with their natural philosophy and natural theology; determinism is part of their doctrine of fate (or ‘destiny’, heimarmenˆ e). To show that freedom is compatible with Stoic determinism, they defend a division between different types of causes, and then argue that the causal role they assign to assent is exactly the role that is needed for freedom and responsibility. The distant past includes an ‘antecedent’ cause of every effect, but it does not include the principal cause. Similarly, it provides necessary conditions for an event. But neither the antecedent cause nor the necessary conditions are the ‘principal’ cause. Though an antecedent cause may make an event inevitable, it does not explain why it happens. To explain an event, we must connect the antecedent causes with the cause that more directly explains the event; this cause is the principal cause. Being a principal cause is a non-transitive relation, whereas being an antecedent cause is transitive. The Stoics connect these claims about causation with their claims about assent by claiming that the principal cause of a rational agent’s action is the agent’s assent. It is the principal cause of Othello’s action because Othello’s assent explains why he acts on an appearance that someone else might have had without acting on it.
- The Stoics believe that our assent is open to inf l uence by rational evaluation, and that praise and blame are forms of rational evaluation, pointing out reasons for and against an action that are appropriately taken into account by an agent who considers whether to assent to an appearance that suggests doing the action. If praise and blame were not concerned with reasons, but were simply expressions of favourable and aversive reactions, or if assent were not inf l uenced by reasons, but only by causal processes immune to reasons, the Stoics would lose the basis for their claim that actions caused by assents are proper objects of praise and blame.
- But they defend their position by pointing out that we can be praised and blamed for having particular passions and for acting on them
- Their arguments against the Sceptics show that they believe assent is not determined by appearances.⁸⁸ In assenting to a perceptual appearance, we are capable of some rational response to evidence and reasons, whether or not they correspond to our most vivid appearance. Similarly, in assenting to an appearance that something is good, we are capable of considering the merits of the appearance and of other appearances apart from their strength and vividness.
- One might suppose that there could be many different consistent and incompatible plans. But the Stoics do not refer to mere consistency; for they do not agree that all consistent plans equally achieve an agent’s good. In their view, the good is not just living consistently, but living in agreement with nature. Our initial impulses give us a natural preference for health over sickness, for relief of hunger over starvation, and so on. The task of practical reason is not simply to devise some internally consistent plan that prevents these impulses from undermining each other. When the Stoics introduce agreement with nature, they reject a subjective conception of one’s good.
- The Stoics take the end to be ‘living with understanding of the things that come about by nature, choosing those that are in accord with nature and rejecting the contrary things’. But ut does not mean that happiness consists in achieving the natural advantages, and virtue is to be valued as a means to achieving happiness.
- To capture the relation between virtue and the result it seeks to achieve, the Stoics distinguish ‘stochastic’ (i.e., ‘aiming’) from non-stochastic crafts. Their distinction rests on a division between the end (f i nis, telos) and the objective (propositum, prokeimenon) of an action or craft. The end is the faultless exercise of the craft, whereas the objective is the external result that this faultless exercise tries to achieve:
    - Non-stochastic craft, such as arithmetic, the achievement of the end of the craft (which is the faultless exercise of the craft), is sufficient for achieving the objective. If we add or subtract, but get the wrong answer, we must have made a mistake in the exercise of the craft and failed to achieve its end
    - Stochastic - we can achieve the end without achieving the objective. Even if our exercise of the craft is faultless, we may still miss the target; perhaps the wind blew it over or someone moved it. A virtue is similar to a stochastic craft, in so far as it has an objective (achieving the natural advantages) and an end (doing all we can to achieve the natural advantages), and achieving the end is not suff i cient for achieving the objective. Virtuous action, therefore, is not suff i cient for achieving the life according to nature, which includes the natural advantages.
- If craftsmen tried to adapt their practice to fit all possible external hazards, they would guess wrongly and come out worse than they would have if they had just aimed at the appropriate exercise of skill in the craft. 
- The features of the product determine what counts as skill in the craft. The expert’s deliberation requires thought about the objective of the craft; this thought about the objective forms our conception of the end, which is the action that constitutes the best exercise of the craft.
