- Reciprocity of the virtues - each virtue requires each of the others
- Virtues not only necessary for happiness, but also are sufficient for happiness
- Excercizing Wisdom (Rational Control) = Happiness
- Rational Control is non-Instrumentally Good
- Virtue = Rational Control => Virtue is non-Instrumentally Good.
- Knowledge is sufficient for acting
- The Naturalism is true. Human functionis to be guided by practical reason
- Concept of assent
- We will accept some priority in justif i cation if we take virtuous actions to be justif i ed primarily as the product of virtues, and do not take virtues to be justif i ed primarily as the source of virtuous actions. But this claim about priority seems to be open to objection. If we have no independent reason to care about the actions resulting from the virtues, but we claim that the virtues are organized for the production of these actions, what reason have we to value the virtues? Critics of the Stoics often raise this objection
- Pain is not bad at all
- Stoics, like Skeptics, value tranquillity, but while Skeptics say that every tranquillity is happiness, stoics think that only proper tranquillity, achieved by a proper way, is the happiness
- Criticise Skeptics: When they say that the Sceptic will be inactive, they do not mean that he will be immobile, or that he will lack goal-directed behaviour. They mean that his goal-directed behaviour will not be rational action.
- Determinism is true. In one of the Stoics’ examples, the action of felling the oak on Mount Pelion is suff i cient, in a deterministic universe, for Medea’s killing of her children.
- They are compatibilist aka soft determinists - determinism is compatible with free will
- They criticise Epicurus' argument against determinism by claiming that causes are more complex
- The growth of non-instrumental concern for practical reason is a result of the instrumental use of practical reason
- The three major Stoics are Zeno, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus
- Still, even though health is not good and illness is not bad, we have good reason to try to be healthy rather than ill. That is why health is a ‘preferred’ indifferent, and illness is a ‘non-preferred’ indifferent.
- The Stoics recognize an ultimate end for rational action, and they follow Aristotle in identifying the end with happiness.¹¹ They also agree with Aristotle in taking happiness to include all and only genuine goods; for they take their claim that ‘only the f i ne is good’ to be equivalent to the claim that virtue is self-suff i cient for happiness
- They do not endorse the extreme moralist view that the requirements of moral virtue and of rightness require agents to act against their happiness or to act without regard to their happiness
- They emphasize the coherence and connexion in their philosophy as a whole
- Prwffered indifferences = external goods
- The Stoics believe that the universe is governed by a divine providential intelligence, aiming at the good of the whole and of each part.
- The Stoics believe that in promoting the good of the whole we promote our own good
- My thought: for Stoics, only actions that are in your controll are the one that matters
- Nothing can harm virtuous man
- Even before agents are guided by explicit preconceptions, their desires are more than a collection of impulses aimed at unconnected satisfactions. They are linked by a common concern for the agent as a whole, conceived as a continuing self. Though the Stoics agree that agents without explicit reason have no explicit conception of themselves as continuing agents, a non-explicit conception of themselves explains the system and co-ordination in their desires. Once we see this system, we cannot suppose that the pleasure of satisfying particular desires is all that they care about for its own sake.
- At an early stage, human beings are like other animals; their appearances include an attractive element, so that if something appears pleasant (etc.), it thereby excites impulse and produces action. Later, however, we acquire the capacity to assent to our appearances and to dissent from them. Our appearances do not change their character; the things that appeared pleasant still appear pleasant, and are therefore still attractive, but we no longer follow them without question. We do not follow them until we assent. Assent is not simply a further appearance directed to the initial appearance. If we formed a tendency to accept or to welcome some appearances and to reject others, we would have what Hume calls a ‘lively idea’. But this is not what the Stoics identify with assent. They argue that whereas appearance is passive, and depends on the environment, assent is active. Appearance is involuntary, and assent is voluntary and depends on our judgment. Assent implies ‘conviction’ or ‘persuasion, which the Sceptic avoids.
- When we begin to assent, we are used to having appearances that have moved us to action by themselves.
These same appearances are still strongly suggestive, and we tend to assent to them.⁴⁹ This sort of assent ‘yields’ to appearances (Plu. SR 1056f = LS 41E; 1057a = LS 53S), and results in an ‘affection’ or ‘passion’ (pathos). A passion is an ‘immediate’ or ‘fresh’ assent that consists in yielding to an appearance that some natural advantage or disadvantage is good or evil.⁵⁰ In immediate assents we yield to our first appearances of how things are. Sometimes we yield immediately because the appearance comes on us suddenly and without preparation.
- In saying that we yield to appearances, the Stoics seek to explain and to correct the common assumption that the passions are ways of being affected rather than ways of acting.
They do not accept this assumption, since they identify a passion with an immediate assent, and all assent is active. Neither animals nor young children have passions,⁵³ because they act on appearance alone, whereas rational agents act on appearance only after assenting to it. When we act on passion, we act on minimal assent, since we fail to interfere with or to question the suggestion that the appearance makes.
By insisting that passion involves assent, the Stoics implicitly deny that we can act on our passions against all our beliefs.⁵⁴ If we seem to act against our beliefs, we really have wavering or oscillating beliefs; though we act against some of our beliefs, we act on other beliefs.⁵⁵ Similarly, passions cannot persist without the relevant beliefs about good and bad.⁵⁶ The passions that the Stoics identify with immediate assents include anger, fear, lust, and all the others that Plato and Aristotle ascribe to the non-rational parts of the soul.
- The Stoics argue that passions belong to the rational part of Platonic trinite soul, because they all assent to the action as good overall.
- Where common sense thinks it sees a conf l ict between rational assent and passion, the Stoics see wavering and vacillation between two conf l icting rational assents resting on conf l icting beliefs about what is best.
- Some sources quote passages in which he seems to recognize the non-rational character of (for instance) anger, and our tendency to persist in it even when we recognize that we ought not to.⁵⁸
