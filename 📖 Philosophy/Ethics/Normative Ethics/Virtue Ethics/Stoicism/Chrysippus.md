- Virtue is both necessary and sufficient for happiness
- Since they call this action a ‘success’ (katorthˆ oma),⁵³ we might suppose that virtuous people succeed more often than other people do in, say, relieving suffering, or defending their community from danger. But this is not the sort of success that the Stoics have in mind. Chrysippus contrasts the sage with a non-sage who does all the appropriate actions that the sage does, but not for the sage’s reasons. He insists that this non-sage is not yet virtuous.
- Their action is successful, and not merely appropriate, because the relevant success consists in acting for the right reason.
- Argues against Ariston's view that there are only 1. Chrisippus says that the virtues differ in their different subject-matters (kephalaia):
    - Prudence is the knowledge of good things and evil and neither.
    - Bravery is the knowledge of what is to be chosen and avoided and neither.
    - Magnanimity is the knowledge or state making someone superior to the things that happen to good and bad people alike. 
    - Continence is a disposition never overcome in what is according to correct reason, or a state invincible by pleasures. 
    - Endurance is the knowledge or the state of what is to be persevered in, not persevered in, or neither.
- Chrysippus envisages someone who grants the distinction that the Stoics draw between goods and preferred indifferents, but still chooses to call preferred indifferents goods.
