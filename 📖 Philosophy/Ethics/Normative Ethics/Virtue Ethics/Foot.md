- To forestall this reaction, and to prove that there are moral categorical imperatives, Kant needs to argue in three stages: (1) He should indicate what a moral categorical imperative will say, if there is any such thing. Hence he should find a plausible supreme principle of morality. (2) He should show that this principle is not simply a hypothetical imperative, because it does not give us a justifying reason by appeal to some antecedent non-moral preference. (3) He should show that it is a categorical imperative. For this purpose, it is not enough to show that it is not a hypothetical imperative; we must also have some reason to accept it independently of whatever else we happen to desire. This reason has to be equally good for every agent who is an appropriate object of justifeid praise and blame. To show that not all imperatives satisfying (2) also satisfy (3), she suggests that principles of etiquette are non-hypothetical imperatives. It is not clear that she is right about this. They are not overtly hypothetical, since they do not say ‘If you want to avoid offending your host, you ought not to eat your peas with a knife’; they are simply principles about what you ought to do. But the hypothetical character of an imperative is determined by the reason that it rests on, not by its explicit expression; if we apply this test, we may argue that imperatives of etiquette are hypothetical or (when they embody moral principles requiring respect and consideration for others) categorical.
