- Mistakely thinks that Aristotle thought that only virtue of character is a real virtue
- Reciprocity of the virtues - each virtue requires each of the others
- The Naturalism is true. Human functionis to be guided by practical reason
- Aquinas marks three aspects of natural law, corresponding to three elements of human nature
- concept of consent
- He is close to Stoics inhis position about a Responsibility
- Christian morality is not only consistent with moral philosophy, as understood by the Greek philosophers, but actually brings out the best in it. He argues that we can see, from the point of view of Greek moral philosophy itself, the moral excellence of the Christian moral outlook, so that this is actually a point in favour of Christianity
- Aquinas explains Paul through his Aristotelian moral psychology.
- Aquinas’ interpretation of Aristotle influenced by Augustine’s version of Stoicism
- Describes the Christian virtues within an explicitly Aristotelian framework
- The passions are the subject of the moral virtues
- Argues against the ‘Augustinian’ position, arguing that Augustine does not hold that greeks did not have virtues at all. Aquinas also say that Christian moral philosophy and theology do not require it.⁹⁰
- Freewill = choice
- Will = rational desire
- The moral philosopher studies sin as a violation of reason, whereas the theologian studies it as a violation of the divine law.
- Freedom, moral and responsibility reduce to facts about rational agency
- Virtues require the perfection of the passions as well as the will.
- We always pursue happiness
- defends a reduction of the voluntary and of freewill to the exercise of will in rational choice
- Human beings also seem to act on passions, not always on deliberated will; and when we act on passions, we act for the sake of an end. But Aquinas seems to exclude these from properly human actions; his treatment of the nature of human action distinguishes properly human actions from the actions common to human and other animals, which are actions on passion. He does not really intend, however, to exclude actions on passion from properly human actions. Properly human actions are voluntary, since they proceed from the will (voluntas); but actions on passion are voluntary if they are appropriately related to the will (1-2 q6 a6–7; q10 a3). Hence actions on passion are included, through their relation to the will, among the properly human actions, and therefore among those that are directed towards an ultimate end.
- Aquinas marks this contrast between rational and non-rational agency by distinguishing determination to a particular good from determination to a universal good. Since the object of the will is the universal good, creatures that lack reason cannot have a will because they cannot grasp a universal good, but are determined to some particular good (1-2 q1 a2 ad3).³⁵ This is why they lack election. Rational agent have a will, that turns them towards universal good, whereas non-rational desires turns only towards particular objects. Non-rational agents make judgements, but only about 1 partucalar thing - hence, their actions also goal-directed, but not rational and free.
- I direct my own action, instead of simply being moved by features of external objects, in so far as I assess my initial value judgments about external objects in the light of my other value judgments.
- Soul consists from :
    - Will - Rational Desire
    - Passions aka Sensory Desires aka Non-Eational desires:
    - appetites
    - spiritual part
- Some passions has ther intellectual twins:
    - Love
    - Joy
    - others
- Passions are passive, because they pushes a man to behave independently of one's whole nature
- Sensory desire is moved by the estimative capacity (aestimativa virtus), so that when a sheep takes a wolf to be an enemy, it is afraid (1a q78 a4).⁶¹ This capacity requires imagination and memory; for the information it conveys (that the wolf is an enemy) is not immediately available to the senses.⁶² In a human being the estimative capacity is the cognitive capacity, or ‘particular reason’, which in turn is moved by universal reason
- Passions do not simply express one’s will, because will is about universal good and passions are about particular good
- He distinguishes sadness ‘in accordance with a complete passion’ (secundum passionem perfectam) from sadness ‘in accordance with a pre-passion’, and attributes only the latter to Christ. By ‘complete passion’ he seems to mean the sort of passion that is capable of carrying away reason by securing consent:
‘sometimes in us <ordinary human beings> movements of this sort do not stop in sensory desire, but draw reason <with them>’. Christ did not have this sort of passion. In using ‘pre-passion’, Aquinas gives the misleading impression that he agrees with the Stoics in regarding such a state as only a precursor of a genuine passion; but his explanation counteracts this impression.
- He agrees with Augustine that Stoics are wrong that there is no non-rational passions
- Aquinas believes, however, that the passions do not characteristically move us to action by themselves; they require the co-operation of will, which essentially pursues the f i nal good.
- Intellectual desire, though it tends towards individual things outside the soul, tends towards them in accordance with some universal character (ratio), as when it desires something because it is good’
- Rational agents have wills, essentially rational desires, in so far as they desire something because it is good, and hence desire in accord with some universal character.⁷⁰ They pursue particular goods not simply because they are attracted to a specif i c sort of object, but also because they take the object to have some valued property that gives a reason for pursuing it.⁷¹ Aquinas captures this aspect of a rational desire in ‘because it is good’; in acting on rational desire we assume that an object is good. This desire is rational because it proceeds by free judgment, not natural judgment, and by rational comparison, not natural instinct.⁷² Comparison is connected with free judgment, because free agents are capable of choosing different things in a particular situation, and so they need some means of comparing the different possibilities.
- The wills (rational desires) and passiins (non-deliberative desires) are different kinds of desire because a deliberative desire is liable to change in circumstances that would not necessarily affect a non-deliberative desire
- The common good that guides deliberation is a f i nal good that provides a basis for selecting what seems best overall (all things considered) - so, ultimate good is possible, because it is possible to find best way to act all things considered
- Even if we do not think about the ultimate end (q1 a6 obj3), we may act for its sake. Travellers on a journey from London to Glasgow try to go from Preston to Carlisle because of their decision to go to Glasgow. They may only be thinking now about how to get from Preston to Carlisle, not about how to get to Glasgow; but they would not be thinking now about getting to Carlisle if they had not decided to go to Glasgow. Their aim is directed ultimately towards the ultimate end, but immediately towards some more proximate end.⁷⁵
- Ultimate end = happiness
- Our pursuit of an ultimate end is necessary for freedom, not a restriction on freedom.
- He derived his account of freedom from his account of an action
- But since actions on passion also seem to be properly human acts, in contrast to the thoughtless scratching of one’s beard, we may wonder how they are related to Aquinas’ account of properly human acts.
- If we necessarily willed the ultimate end as having some highly determinate content specifying a particular action, we would not be rational agents, since we would not act on rational comparison of different possible objects of pursuit.
- This deliberation begins from our aiming at (intendere) an end, not simply from wishing it. To wish for an end is only to recognize that we would prefer getting something over failing to get it, or that we would be pleased if we could get it; this sort of wish is simply a ‘velleity’.⁵ We might have several such preferences, but to begin deliberation we must set out to satisfy one rather than another of them. We direct ourselves towards getting an end;
‘for we are said to aim at health not simply because we will it, but because we will to reach it through something else’ (q12 a1 ad4). ‘Through something else’ refers to means, but not to any particular means; we can aim at an end without having determined the means, which are the concern of election (q12 a4 ad3). By ‘directing’ (ordinare) ourselves towards trying to attain the end (q12 a1 ad1), we differ from non-rational agents: to aim (intendere) is to tend (tendere) towards something; and this belongs to the mover and to the moved. non-rational animals also aim at an end, to the extent that they are moved to something by natural instinct. But in another way aiming at an end belongs to the mover, in so far as he directs the movement of himself or another towards an end. This belongs only to reason. That is why non-rational animals do not aim at an end in this way, which is aiming properly and principally
- Aquinas believes that if we direct our action towards an end, we are also in control of our actions. Rational agents aim at an end in directing themselves actively, not in being directed passively.⁹ I direct my action towards an end in so far as I limit my inclination towards this action by my estimate of the end that it is directed to. To do this, I must also be able to estimate the value of this end;¹⁰ hence I must have some idea of what makes it an end for me and of what is good about it. This is why rational agents must present the end to themselves. Rational agent can see a structure of a means to end: sometimes ends become means, sometime means become ends, both through deliberation.
- From the fact that deliberating reason is related to opposites it results that the will is capable of going in both directions
- Aiming, as opposed to merely wishing, requires us to look for means to our end.
- Mental states leading from will to action:
    1. Aiming at the end
    2. Deliberation - finding means for achieving an end. Deliberation includes questions about what an end consists in.
    3. Consent - Before we can act, we have to engage our capacities to move ourselves; and this ‘engaging’ or ‘application’ of our motive capacities is what Aquinas calls consent. This stages check whether a means is possible
    4. Election - Consent recognizes something as satisfactory; from this preliminary recognition election picks out one of the satisfactory things as better than another. If we recognize only one thing as satisfactory, the same action is both consent and election; in this case they differ only in definition (ratione tantum). If we recognize several things as satisfactory, we elect one over the others. This stage finds one mean as the best all things considered
- Aquinas' election are not Stoics' assent - because election needs alternatives while assent doesn't
- Our will follows our conception of the overall good, which rests on our comparative estimate of various specif i c goods. Passions inf l uence this comparative estimate by bringing particular goods to our attention and presenting them in a favourable light that alters our estimate of how good they are.
- The will can influence passions by:
    - Force:
        - Restraining
        - Arousing new passions
    - Permission to act on the passions
- He argues against Stoics' view that passions give us false appearance of a universal goodnes of an action: he thinks that passions give us appearances only of a particular goods: a passion inclines us to value judgments that we would not otherwise have formed (1-2 q9 a2). Under its inf l uence we form particular value judgments (‘it would be good to retaliate for this insult’) whose generalizations (‘it is good to retaliate for insults’) we would not accept if we considered them (q9 a2 ad2). When we are inf l uenced by passions, we do not judge on the basis that we would normally endorse. A passion makes some particular course of action appear more attractive than it would appear otherwise.
- If the will permits and regulates, we can act on passions without deliberation.³⁷ If the action was wrong, the will made an error by omission; the error depends on a cause or occasion of omission that is subject to the will.³⁸ What I do now without an election on this occasion results from previous election, if I have elected to allow myself to be affected by certain sorts of desires, or if I have declined the opportunity to avoid them. Hence my will, through my conception of my ultimate end, inf l uences actions that conf l ict with my conception of the ultimate end. My failure to recognize all the implications of my conception of the ultimate end makes it intelligible that I allow actions that, if I thought about them more carefully, I would not allow. Aquinas’ views on regulation and permission also suggest that we act on passion if we simply consent to the passion by non-intervention. Non-intervention need not result from a deliberate choice not to intervene; we may simply be too hasty or too lazy to think about whether we ought to intervene. Such haste or laziness partly depends on our will, just as the later stages of a journey are dependent on the elections that we made at earlier stages;
for our previous deliberation and choice affect our later tendency to stop and think or to proceed without thinking.
- Will is an essentially rational desire aiming at a universal good.
- Aquinas rejects the extreme intellectualist view that reason is the primary cause of rational action, so that will is simply an intermediary cause that is ultimately explained by reference to reason. He also rejects the extreme voluntarist view that will is the primary cause of rational action and reason is only a secondary cause, so that the role of reason is subordinate to the role of will. Against these two extreme views Aquinas argues that action proceeds primarily from the will, but the will is rational desire, and is therefore essentially guided by our intellectual conception of the greatest good. A voluntarist rejects this account of action, but still agrees with Aquinas in accepting rationalism about the relation of will to passion.
We will eventually need to ask whether this combination of voluntarism and rationalism is coherent or plausible; but if we do not recognize the difference between intellectualism and rationalism, we cannot even see the questions that need to be asked.
- Aquinas agrees with Aristotle’s claim that thought by itself moves nothing, and that in order to initiate motion it must be ‘thought for the sake of some end’ (EN 1139a35–6). Aristotle believes that this goal-directed thought initiating action requires the presence of desire. Similarly, Aquinas asserts that our cognitive capacity does not move us without desire as intermediary.
- Aquinas does not suggest that deliberation simply causes our desire to pass from the end through the prediction that this action will promote the end.⁵⁰ We recognize that the action deserves to be done, and our recognition moves our will. In this respect, intellect commands acts of the will. But intellect does not command all acts of the will, since it presupposes an act of will.
We would not deliberate, and hence we would not reach a conclusion that could be the content of a command, unless we had wills that aimed at the good. The simple recognition that something deserves to be done would make no systematic difference to our action unless we had wills—forms of desire that respond to what deserves to be done. If we could recognize what is worth doing, but we had no wills, our recognition that it is worthwhile to learn to play the violin would not affect us in itself; it would affect us only if we already had some non-rational preference for playing the violin or for some end to which it seems to be a means. Hence intellect moves the will as f i nal cause, whereas the will moves the intellect as eff i cient cause (1a q82 a4). The ‘active’ function of the will is prominent in interpretations that minimize the extent of Aquinas’ intellectualism.⁵¹ He points out that our deliberation is inf l uenced not only by the end that we want to achieve, but also by whether we choose to deliberate, how much we choose to deliberate, and what we choose to consider in our deliberation.⁵² Since these choices depend on the will, some operations of intellect depend on will. Though the exercise of will in election depends on intellect, the will does not depend wholly on intellect. It also depends on the initial contribution of will in controlling the focus and the character of our deliberation.
- He does not hold a voluntarist conception of this role of will; for he does not claim that in this role the will is free to choose independently of the apparent good.
- The will moves the intellect as eff i cient cause whereas the intellect moves the will as formal and f i nal cause.⁵⁷ The intellect has a causal role because it presents to the will the end that explains the will’s willing a particular action (bodily or mental) for the sake of the end;
and in presenting this end it also gives the will the relevant form (being the will to achieve this end). These different causal roles express the fact that our will moves us in a particular direction only because it aims at a particular end as good, and depends on the intellect to present it to us as good.
- Aquinas’ position, therefore, is moderate rather than extreme intellectualism, but it is a form of intellectualism rather than a combination of intellectualism and voluntarism. It avoids the extreme intellectualist claim that intellect independent of will determines will and action, but it also avoids the voluntarist claim that will independent of intellect determines intellect and action. We necessarily desire what we apprehend as promoting the ultimate good; if we fail to choose something that at f i rst seemed to promote the ultimate good, we have changed our mind about whether it really promotes the ultimate good.⁵⁸ We act rationally in so far as intellect constrains the operation of the will. In Aquinas’ view, we cannot f i rmly believe that x rather than y promotes the good, and then—while still clearly understanding and f i rmly believing this—will y rather than x. This intellectual constraint on the will applies no less to the acts of will that inf l uence deliberation than to those that result from deliberation.
- There are both External and Internal reasons
- insisting on a basic desire for the ultimate good, Aquinas implies that we can grasp external reasons only in relation to each other and to their common end. He is therefore a rationalist about will and passion, since he does not believe that the rational merits of a given action are determined by an antecedent desire with some determinate content. He believes that our desires are directed towards action on the recognition of the rational merits of a course of action.
- Aquinas believes that his conception of the will and the passions and of their relations allows us to understand the distinction (i) between voluntary and involuntary actions, and (ii) between free and unfree actions.
- Aquinas cannot reasonably deny that actions on non-rational desires are voluntary; for he agrees with Aristotle that they are open to praise and blame.
- A morally bad action results when the will breaks out towards action (in actionem prorumpit) either (i) on an apprehension belonging to sense, or (ii) on an apprehension of reason presenting some good different from one’s proper good (10 §1949).
- Since Aquinas presents his account of the voluntary as an account of the basis of justif i ed praise and blame, he believes that if we are voluntary agents, we also have freewill.
- My freedom in making the choice depends on whether I freely make the judgment underlying the choice (1a q83 a2 obj1). If freewill is a potentiality, it must be identif i ed with the potentiality that ensures freedom in our judgments
- To show that freewill is the same as will, Aquinas considers reasons for believing they are different.
- Aquinas claims to have found a place for free choice within his account of the will, through his description of election as the outcome of will and deliberation. Therefore he identif i es the exercise of freewill with election, which he takes to be an exercise of will. Electing is different from merely willing, but it does not require any further capacity beyond willing and deliberating (2Sent d24 q1 a3 sol. = P 595b). Willing and electing are different states of the same capacity
- Though we necessarily will the indeterminate ultimate end, it is still left to us to deliberate about what we think it consists in, and therefore we are not necessitated to choose the particular action that we eventually elect.
- Aquinas confronts a related question about uncertainty in his discussion of deliberation and election. He argues that uncertainty, inquiry, and deliberation are not necessary for election. Since he allows election without uncertainty, and since he takes election to imply freewill, he also allows freewill without uncertainty.
- He therefore claims that God and the angels have freedom, even though they do not need to inquire and they do not face uncertainty. God does not will necessarily everything that he wills. God wills his goodness necessarily, and he wills some other things because of his good-ness, but these things are not necessary for his goodness, and he does not will them necessar-ily.⁴⁵This is why God has freewill.⁴⁶Angels do not choose what they do through deliberation, since their mode of knowledge does not need inquiry; and so their freedom does not rest on deliberation (1a q59 a3 ad1). In these cases where there is no uncertainty and no inquiry, Aquinasarguesthatnonetheless‘whereverthereisintellect,thereisfreewill’.⁴⁷ Freedomrests on the fact that our choice of one good over another is determined by our judgment about its greater goodness; in human agents this judgment about goodness results from deliberation. 
their choice is not limited by inability to consider any alternatives that ought to be considered. They choose the action they choose as a result of thought that appropriately weighs any different options that they need to weigh;
the fact that no weighing is necessary does not make it any less true that their thought is capable of weighing. Since no inability to weigh causes them to act as they do without deliberation, they act freely.
- He intends his analysis of rational agency to explain his account of freedom. His view is not that we have freewill despite our lacking freedom in relation to the ultimate end. On the contrary, we have freewill precisely because we are not free not to pursue an ultimate
- Free choice requires election because non-rational desire is ‘determined to one object’, whereas rational desire is not. Hence creatures with only non-rational desire lack election. They are free in relation to external circumstances, but not in relation to their desires, since the relative strength of their desires determines their action. Rational agents are free in relation to their desires, since they can alter the relative strength of their desires.
- If we did not pursue a f i nal good, we would have no basis for evaluating one object of desire in comparison to another; when we compare one object of desire in the light of what matters most to us, we rely on our conception of our f i nal good, as Aquinas understands it. We act rationally in so far as we regulate our actions and choices by some deliberate and ref l ective view of their connexion with the ultimate end; this feature of rational action distinguishes it from the action of non-rational animals, who lack the conception of an ultimate end and so cannot regulate their actions by it. 
- If, however, we are free in the choice of ends, we must recognize external reasons; we must be able to appeal to some reason, apart from the strength of our desire, for pursuing one end over another. We are free in relation to ends because we can choose them in accordance with standards of goodness that are external to our desiring and valuing. 
- Aquinas rejects Socratic intellectualism, and hence rejects the reduction of vice to ignorance.
- But Aquinas’ conditions for freewill could be satisf i ed even if all our choices and actions were causally necessitated. Its choice of non-ultimate goods is ‘not determined’, in the respect that it is not determined independently of our reasoning; it rests on the consideration of alternatives.
- He believes that the will of rational agents is immaterial, and so cannot be determined by external physical causes (1-2 q9 a5); but his immaterialism is not necessary for his defence of freewill.
- Our dissatisfaction presupposes that all our ends ought to be co-ordinated, and that none ought to be insulated from comparison with others; hence we already value the co-ordination of all our ends, and we pursue a single co-ordinated system. This is the system that Aquinas describes as a single ultimate end. Aquinas’ claim that the will necessarily takes the ultimate end as its object is not simply a statement of psychological necessity; it is not comparable, for instance, to the claim that we tend to prefer the interests of people we know well, or tend to prefer what will happen in a month over what will happen in ten years. Nor, on the other hand, is it logically necessary that every conceivable agent with desires, or even every conceivable agent capable of deliberation about the satisfaction of its desires, pursues an ultimate end.
Aquinas’ description of an ultimate end offers a partial def i nition of a will. If we could show that an agent’s desires were not arranged and modif i ed in the light of some conception of an ultimate end, we would thereby have shown that the agent is not rational and has no will. Aquinas’ claim that human beings have wills, therefore, does not follow from the mere fact that we have desires, or even from the fact that we are capable of inf l uencing them in some ways by deliberation. In claiming that we have wills, he claims that our desire and deliberation have the structure that relies on a comprehensive (it is a term) ultimate end.
- Necessary acceptance of Principle of Non-Contradiction aka PNC makes someone a rational subject of belief and knowledge; necessary pursuit of the ultimate good makes someone a rational agent.
- Following Plato and Aristotle, he believes that a distinct type of desire belongs to each part of the tripartite soul.
- The desires of the non-rational parts aim at things that we recognize as actual objects of our desires (or means to achieving these objects). The desire of the rational part is directed to things whose properties merit their being desired, not to things that are already desired.
- Ultimate end is not simply an ordered collection of objects of our basic preferences. We also treat it as including external reasons in support of our basic preferences.
- If this feature of the will implies that we desire goods that are good independently of our desiring them, so that our desiring them does not constitute their goodness, our conception of the ultimate end appeals to a standard of perfection beyond mere comprehensiveness
- He believes that this complete happiness can be achieved only in the afterlife, when we gain all the features of happiness that we cannot achieve in this life. Every good other than the f i nal good itself lacks some good from some point of view; this is why deliberation is needed for us to choose it.⁵⁰
