- Mistakely thinks that Aristotle thought that only virtue of character is a real virtue
- Reciprocity of the virtues - each virtue requires each of the others
- The Naturalism is true. Human functionis to be guided by practical reason
- Aquinas marks three aspects of natural law, corresponding to three elements of human nature
- concept of consent
- He is close to Stoics inhis position about a Responsibility
- Christian morality is not only consistent with moral philosophy, as understood by the Greek philosophers, but actually brings out the best in it. He argues that we can see, from the point of view of Greek moral philosophy itself, the moral excellence of the Christian moral outlook, so that this is actually a point in favour of Christianity
- Aquinas explains Paul through his Aristotelian moral psychology.
- Aquinas’ interpretation of Aristotle influenced by Augustine’s version of Stoicism
- Describes the Christian virtues within an explicitly Aristotelian framework
- The passions are the subject of the moral virtues
- Argues against the ‘Augustinian’ position, arguing that Augustine does not hold that greeks did not have virtues at all. Aquinas also say that Christian moral philosophy and theology do not require it.⁹⁰
- Freewill = choice
- Will = rational desire
- The moral philosopher studies sin as a violation of reason, whereas the theologian studies it as a violation of the divine law.
- Freedom, moral and responsibility reduce to facts about rational agency
- Virtues require the perfection of the passions as well as the will.
- We always pursue happiness
- defends a reduction of the voluntary and of freewill to the exercise of will in rational choice
- Human beings also seem to act on passions, not always on deliberated will; and when we act on passions, we act for the sake of an end. But Aquinas seems to exclude these from properly human actions; his treatment of the nature of human action distinguishes properly human actions from the actions common to human and other animals, which are actions on passion. He does not really intend, however, to exclude actions on passion from properly human actions. Properly human actions are voluntary, since they proceed from the will (voluntas); but actions on passion are voluntary if they are appropriately related to the will (1-2 q6 a6–7; q10 a3). Hence actions on passion are included, through their relation to the will, among the properly human actions, and therefore among those that are directed towards an ultimate end.
- Aquinas marks this contrast between rational and non-rational agency by distinguishing determination to a particular good from determination to a universal good. Since the object of the will is the universal good, creatures that lack reason cannot have a will because they cannot grasp a universal good, but are determined to some particular good (1-2 q1 a2 ad3).³⁵ This is why they lack election. Rational agent have a will, that turns them towards universal good, whereas non-rational desires turns only towards particular objects. Non-rational agents make judgements, but only about 1 partucalar thing - hence, their actions also goal-directed, but not rational and free.
- I direct my own action, instead of simply being moved by features of external objects, in so far as I assess my initial value judgments about external objects in the light of my other value judgments.
- Soul consists from :
    - Will - Rational Desire
    - Passions aka Sensory Desires aka Non-Eational desires:
    - appetites
    - spiritual part
- Some passions has ther intellectual twins:
    - Love
    - Joy
    - others
- Passions are passive, because they pushes a man to behave independently of one's whole nature
- Sensory desire is moved by the estimative capacity (aestimativa virtus), so that when a sheep takes a wolf to be an enemy, it is afraid (1a q78 a4).⁶¹ This capacity requires imagination and memory; for the information it conveys (that the wolf is an enemy) is not immediately available to the senses.⁶² In a human being the estimative capacity is the cognitive capacity, or ‘particular reason’, which in turn is moved by universal reason
- Passions do not simply express one’s will, because will is about universal good and passions are about particular good
- He distinguishes sadness ‘in accordance with a complete passion’ (secundum passionem perfectam) from sadness ‘in accordance with a pre-passion’, and attributes only the latter to Christ. By ‘complete passion’ he seems to mean the sort of passion that is capable of carrying away reason by securing consent:
‘sometimes in us <ordinary human beings> movements of this sort do not stop in sensory desire, but draw reason <with them>’. Christ did not have this sort of passion. In using ‘pre-passion’, Aquinas gives the misleading impression that he agrees with the Stoics in regarding such a state as only a precursor of a genuine passion; but his explanation counteracts this impression.
- He agrees with Augustine that Stoics are wrong that there is no non-rational passions
- Aquinas believes, however, that the passions do not characteristically move us to action by themselves; they require the co-operation of will, which essentially pursues the f i nal good.
- Intellectual desire, though it tends towards individual things outside the soul, tends towards them in accordance with some universal character (ratio), as when it desires something because it is good’
- Rational agents have wills, essentially rational desires, in so far as they desire something because it is good, and hence desire in accord with some universal character.⁷⁰ They pursue particular goods not simply because they are attracted to a specif i c sort of object, but also because they take the object to have some valued property that gives a reason for pursuing it.⁷¹ Aquinas captures this aspect of a rational desire in ‘because it is good’; in acting on rational desire we assume that an object is good. This desire is rational because it proceeds by free judgment, not natural judgment, and by rational comparison, not natural instinct.⁷² Comparison is connected with free judgment, because free agents are capable of choosing different things in a particular situation, and so they need some means of comparing the different possibilities.
- The wills (rational desires) and passiins (non-deliberative desires) are different kinds of desire because a deliberative desire is liable to change in circumstances that would not necessarily affect a non-deliberative desire
- The common good that guides deliberation is a f i nal good that provides a basis for selecting what seems best overall (all things considered) - so, ultimate good is possible, because it is possible to find best way to act all things considered
- Even if we do not think about the ultimate end (q1 a6 obj3), we may act for its sake. Travellers on a journey from London to Glasgow try to go from Preston to Carlisle because of their decision to go to Glasgow. They may only be thinking now about how to get from Preston to Carlisle, not about how to get to Glasgow; but they would not be thinking now about getting to Carlisle if they had not decided to go to Glasgow. Their aim is directed ultimately towards the ultimate end, but immediately towards some more proximate end.⁷⁵
- Ultimate end = happiness
- Our pursuit of an ultimate end is necessary for freedom, not a restriction on freedom.
- He derived his account of freedom from his account of an action
