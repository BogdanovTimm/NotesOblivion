- Mistakely thinks that Aristotle thought that only virtue of character is a real virtue
- Reciprocity of the virtues - each virtue requires each of the others
- The Naturalism is true. Human functionis to be guided by practical reason
- Aquinas marks three aspects of natural law, corresponding to three elements of human nature
- concept of consent
- He is close to Stoics inhis position about a Responsibility
- Christian morality is not only consistent with moral philosophy, as understood by the Greek philosophers, but actually brings out the best in it. He argues that we can see, from the point of view of Greek moral philosophy itself, the moral excellence of the Christian moral outlook, so that this is actually a point in favour of Christianity
- Aquinas explains Paul through his Aristotelian moral psychology.
- Aquinas’ interpretation of Aristotle influenced by Augustine’s version of Stoicism
- Describes the Christian virtues within an explicitly Aristotelian framework
- The passions are the subject of the moral virtues
- Argues against the ‘Augustinian’ position, arguing that Augustine does not hold that greeks did not have virtues at all. Aquinas also say that Christian moral philosophy and theology do not require it.⁹⁰
- Freewill = choice
- Will = rational desire
- The moral philosopher studies sin as a violation of reason, whereas the theologian studies it as a violation of the divine law.
- Freedom, moral and responsibility reduce to facts about rational agency
- Virtues require the perfection of the passions as well as the will.
- We always pursue happiness
- defends a reduction of the voluntary and of freewill to the exercise of will in rational choice
- Human beings also seem to act on passions, not always on deliberated will; and when we act on passions, we act for the sake of an end. But Aquinas seems to exclude these from properly human actions; his treatment of the nature of human action distinguishes properly human actions from the actions common to human and other animals, which are actions on passion. He does not really intend, however, to exclude actions on passion from properly human actions. Properly human actions are voluntary, since they proceed from the will (voluntas); but actions on passion are voluntary if they are appropriately related to the will (1-2 q6 a6–7; q10 a3). Hence actions on passion are included, through their relation to the will, among the properly human actions, and therefore among those that are directed towards an ultimate end.
- Aquinas marks this contrast between rational and non-rational agency by distinguishing determination to a particular good from determination to a universal good. Since the object of the will is the universal good, creatures that lack reason cannot have a will because they cannot grasp a universal good, but are determined to some particular good (1-2 q1 a2 ad3).³⁵ This is why they lack election. Rational agent have a will, that turns them towards universal good, whereas non-rational desires turns only towards particular objects. Non-rational agents make judgements, but only about 1 partucalar thing - hence, their actions also goal-directed, but not rational and free.
- I direct my own action, instead of simply being moved by features of external objects, in so far as I assess my initial value judgments about external objects in the light of my other value judgments.
- Soul consists from :
    - will - rational desire
    - sensory desire - non-rational desire
