# Thesesis

- Reciprocity of the virtues - each virtue requires each of the others
- Virtues are necessary for happiness (but not sufficient)
- Wisdom is not an only Instrumental Good, but it is not Happiness
- Feiendship = type of love for persons as non-instrumental concern for the good of others
- The supremacy of reasons based on one’s own good for being moral both psychologically and rationally.
- Virtue promotes happiness more than the vice does
- The best life is also the pleasantest life
- if we have one virtue we have all the virtues
- Plato's division of the soul is true
- Happiness = highest good
- Happiness is composite
- According to one reasonable interpretation, he argues that happiness is a composite good, and that the virtues are dominant parts of it.
- Aristotle, however, distinguishes two sorts of goal-directed actions: 
    - production (poiˆ esis) aims at some end other than the production itself, 
    - ‘action’ or ‘activity’ (praxis) ‘good action itself is the end’
- A virtue of character is ‘a state that decides’. 
- Decision is the product of wish and deliberation. It is a central feature of responsible action and of virtue. In requiring the right decision, Aristotle seeks to describe the rational element in virtue. 
- we decide on actions as promoting ends, not as ends themselves, but he also insists that the virtuous person decides on the virtuous action for its own sake. This paradox dissolves, and the coherence of Aristotle’s position becomes clear, once we apply the distinction between production and activity to Aristotle’s claims about decision:  The virtuous person decides on virtuous actions as activities that in themselves, not simply through their consequences, partly achieve the end.
- He uses dialectical method: he tries to resolve conflicts in commom knowledge about ethics
- ... [it is the same] Cognitive state as prudence (phronesis), which deliberates about what promotes happiness as a whole
- Political science is a sort of an practical science where we tries to find the highest end and so we cannot appeal to any higher end to give us a definite conception of our end. It uses a dialectical inquery for that.  Political science is practical rather than productive, because it is concerned with ‘action’ (praxis) and not simply with ‘production’ or ‘making’ (poiesis). 
- Action is itself the end that we aim at, not a mere means to some end external to it. If we are trying to f i nd the appropriate form of non-instrumental action, we cannot simply consider its causal consequences for the production of some external end; we need to see how it can non-instrumentally realize an end that it partly constitutes.
- There is 1 final end  that is human goodness of the rational agents (opposed to a non-rational desires) aka happiness
- General justice - other regarding virtue
- Descision = rational desire
