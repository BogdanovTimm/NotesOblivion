- Reciprocity of the virtues - each virtue requires each of the others
- Virtues are necessary for happiness (but not sufficient)
- Virtue is a state in which one performs one’s function well. Hence a virtue is a state in which one makes the correct rational choice of ends, and chooses correctly the actions that are to be chosen for their own sakes. 
- Practical reason is a part or element in the end, not simply a means to it. Moreover, the relevant sort of practical reason is the rational selection and choice of components of the human good.
- Wisdom is not an only Instrumental Good, but it is not Happiness
- Feiendship = type of love for persons as non-instrumental concern for the good of others
- The supremacy of reasons based on one’s own good for being moral both psychologically and rationally.
- Virtue promotes happiness more than the vice does
- The best life is also the pleasantest life
- if we have one virtue we have all the virtues
- Plato's division of the soul is true
- Happiness = highest good
- Happiness is composite
- According to one reasonable interpretation, he argues that happiness is a composite good, and that the virtues are dominant parts of it.
- Aristotle, however, distinguishes two sorts of goal-directed actions: 
    - production (poiˆ esis) aims at some end other than the production itself, 
    - ‘action’ or ‘activity’ (praxis) ‘good action itself is the end’
- A virtue of character is ‘a state that decides’. 
- Decision is the product of wish and deliberation. It is a central feature of responsible action and of virtue. In requiring the right decision, Aristotle seeks to describe the rational element in virtue. 
- we decide on actions as promoting ends, not as ends themselves, but he also insists that the virtuous person decides on the virtuous action for its own sake. This paradox dissolves, and the coherence of Aristotle’s position becomes clear, once we apply the distinction between production and activity to Aristotle’s claims about decision:  The virtuous person decides on virtuous actions as activities that in themselves, not simply through their consequences, partly achieve the end.
- He uses dialectical method: he tries to resolve conflicts in commom knowledge about ethics
- ... [it is the same] Cognitive state as prudence (phronesis), which deliberates about what promotes happiness as a whole
- Political science is a sort of an practical science where we tries to find the highest end and so we cannot appeal to any higher end to give us a definite conception of our end. It uses a dialectical inquery for that.  Political science is practical rather than productive, because it is concerned with ‘action’ (praxis) and not simply with ‘production’ or ‘making’ (poiesis). 
- Action is itself the end that we aim at, not a mere means to some end external to it. If we are trying to f i nd the appropriate form of non-instrumental action, we cannot simply consider its causal consequences for the production of some external end; we need to see how it can non-instrumentally realize an end that it partly constitutes.
- There is 1 final end  that is human goodness of the rational agents (opposed to a non-rational desires) aka happiness
- General justice - other regarding virtue
- Descision = rational desire
- Psychological egoism is true (every person pursue hers own happiness)
- the virtuous person’s life is also the pleasantest life, because pleasure makes live happier, but pleasure is not only thing that makes live happier. Also, virtues makes virtues people less depenfend on external circumstances (but, not independent of them, which is impossible)
- He recognizes pleasure, honour, understanding and virtue as non-instrumental goods (1097b2–4). If he accepts a comprehensive conception of happiness, he regards these goods as components of happiness.
- We choose non-instrumental goods for the sake of happiness, but may choose for they own sake if we can't pursue all of them at once
- the wellfare of my friends, family and fellow-citizens are the parts of my own wellfare (not becase it may affect my wellfare)
- A human being’s function is activity of the rational soul; hence a human being’s good is activity of the rational soul in accordance with complete virtue
- Functions of X = essence of X
- Function = goal-directed motion or state. A motion or state is goal-directed when it has a final cause aka ‘end’. A final cause is the real or apparent good whose presence explains the occurrence of the motion or state in question.
- The function of a whole organism is what Aristotle describes as a life
- The Function Argument does not show, and is not intended to show, that happiness consists in performing the activity that is most distinctive of human beings in relation to other organisms. It connects a human being’s good with the characteristic and distinctive features of a rational agent’s life as opposed to the life of other agents
- Something unnatural (medical pills) may be 'in accordance' with one's nature
- Human function consists in rational choice of actions valued for their own sakes. A life devoted to the pursuit of ends that do not result from rational choice of ends does not fulfil the human function, even if the agent exercises reason in deliberation about instrumental means to those ends.
- Plato's conception of the soul is true
- different moral virtues are different ways in which we fulf i l our nature as rational agents in a life guided by non-instrumental practical reasoning.
- virtuous people do not achieve happiness simply because they attach supreme value to virtuous action; they achieve it only in so far as virtuous action actually meets the appropriate conditions for happiness. These conditions include completeness, self-suff i ciency, and realization of a human being’s practical rationality
- Virtues are the different ways in which the non-rational part accepts the guidance of the rational part.
- Happiness consists in part in theoretical ‘study’ or ‘contemplation’ (theˆ oria), grasping the ultimate universal truths about the universe
- According to the Function Argument, the different virtues should be forms of control by the rational part in the choice of ends
- We fulf i l our function by acting in accordance with both prudence and virtue of characte
- Mere agreement between rational and non-rational parts of the soul are not sufficient to be virtuous, because vicious person also has this agreement
- For a normal and natural human emotion such as anger, four possibilities are open: 
    1. Indulgence, leaving it completely unchecked. 
    2. Suppression, as far as possible.
    3. Control, as far as possible.
    4. Harmony and agreement with the rational part. It is the best option. It means that if you have some justified inclination for anger, but you understand that it is not the best time for it, you will feel inclination, but it will be small. And it is better than not to feel it. Also, in some situations, I must feel regret for my doibgs
- a life of action (praxis) of the rational part - he takes the distinctively human function to consist not merely in the use of reason, and not merely in the use of reason to select one action over another, but also in the use of reason in praxis, in action chosen for its own sake
- For if someone who abstains from bodily pleasures enjoys the abstinence itself, he is temperate; if he is grieved by it, he is intemperate. Again, if he stands f i rm against terrifying situations and enjoys it, or at least does not f i nd it painful, he is brave; if he f i nds it painful, he is cowardly
