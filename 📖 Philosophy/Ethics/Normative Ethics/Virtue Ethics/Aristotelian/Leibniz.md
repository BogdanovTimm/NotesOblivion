- Argues against Augustinian claim that virtues of a pagans are actually sins
- The Aristotelian conception makes the grasp of natural law a part of the rational grasp of the ultimate end by rational agents.
- In ‘On nature itself’, he turns the theological argument back on his opponents; they diminish God’s creative power if they deny that God has created substances that are capable of initiating their own goal-directed movements. If we agree that God creates substances that are suffciiently complex to have natures and ends, we have some reason to agree that their nature also fixes what is good and right for them.³ 
- Leibniz suggests that his opponents’ view tends towards the occasionalism of Malebranche.⁴ Leibniz believes his opponents have to say: ‘ . . . things do not act but . . . God acts in the presence of things and according to the fitness of things, so that things are occasions, not causes, and merely receive but never effect or produce’ 
- Since Leibniz believes that the Scholastic outlook does not deserve to be wholly discarded, he agrees with those who take a Lutheran and a naturalist outlook to be compatible.
- In discussion with Bossuet, he suggests that differences between Protestants and Roman Catholics are not irreconcilable.⁸
- Leibniz revives the eudaemonism of Aristotelian ethics. He accepts it as a psychological doctrine; hence he claims that we always pursue our own good, and that allegedly incontinent action is really the result of ignorance of our good. Sometimes he appears to be a psychological egoist, and even a hedonist. He understands happiness (felicity) as ‘a lasting state of pleasure’.⁹ He understands love in the same way, but he allows it to include ‘disinterested’ love, which nonetheless is inseparable from one’s own pleasure.¹⁰
- Perhaps, then, Leibniz really means that happiness consists in pleasure taken in appropriate activities and states. If this is what he means, it is more intelligible to regard the object of the pleasure as part of one’s happiness. Hence it is more intelligible to regard the good of another person as a part of one’s own good. 
- Though Leibniz recognizes the possibility of love for another person for the other’s own sake, and hence of non-mercenary love, he does not identify this with purely disinterested love. He rejects any disinterested love that is separated from one’s concern for one’s own good. But his composite view of happiness allows love of another to be essential to one’s own good, and not simply instrumental to it; in this sense, Leibniz believes in disinterested love of God. 
- He complicates his views about motivation and reason still further by describing pleasure as the ‘sense’ of perfection. Here he suggests that perfection is the end and pleasure is just the sign of our having achieved it. If this is what he means, he avoids a purely hedonist conception of the ultimate end, and thereby allows a more intelligible notion of disinterested concern. His modifications of hedonism help to explain why Leibniz is sympathetic to traditional eudaemonism, which treats disinterested concern for another as part of one’s own good. He shares this sympathy with Shaftesbury, and so endorses some of Shaftesbury’s defence of unselfsih moral attitudes.

- But he may not present the traditional eudaemonist view in its most plausible form. He connects naturalism and eudaemonism with some doctrines that are absent from Aquinas and Suarez, and that might reasonably arouse Kant’s suspicion. 
- - This conception of disinterested love allows Leibniz to endorse the pursuit of virtue for its own sake. He approves of most of Shaftesbury’s attitude to morality and the moral motive. In his view, non-mercenary love is possible insofar as the happiness of those in whose happiness we take pleasure becomes a part of our own happiness. If we fnid pleasure ‘in’ the good of another, the happiness of others turns into our own happiness.¹¹ This position shares some of the obscurities of Shaftesbury’s position. It is not clear whether Leibniz’s claims about happiness rest on hedonist assumptions or not. Indeed, he seems to raise some difficulties for a strictly hedonist account of happiness. If happiness consists entirely in pleasure, we can find pleasure ‘in’ some object only insofar as the object is a source of pleasure, but not something valued for its own sake. In this sense, an Epicurean hedonist can find pleasure ‘in’ the pleasure of another.¹² But this construal of ‘pleasure in’ does not explain how the happiness of others could ‘turn into’ our own happiness. However important your pleasure may be in causing my pleasure, this causal role does not make it either the whole or a part of my pleasure. Alternatively, if I take pleasure in something as the essential object of this pleasure, the object is not simply causally related to the pleasure, but internally connected to the value of the pleasure itself. If this is what Leibniz means, he cannot consistently identify good exclusively with pleasure; for I identify my good with pleasure in this specific object, on the assumption that this object is intrinsically appropriate, and hence valuable in its own right. 
- If disinterested love (as Leibniz understands it) promotes one’s own good, the disinterested pursuit of virtue should promote one’s own good. This is nonetheless true even if virtue does not yield greater pleasure than any other way of life, according to some neutral measure of quantity of pleasure. Shaftesbury’s case seems to rely on arguments and assumptions that Leibniz endorses; and so Leibniz does not explain why Shaftesbury is wrong. 
- Leibniz need not withdraw his claim that divine rewards and punishments are important. Even if they are not necessary to make virtue promote one’s happiness, they may provide signifciant further reasons for believing this claim, and especially for believing that virtue does not require a long-term sacrifice of happiness. Shaftesbury agrees on these points. But it does not follow that divine rewards and punishments are needed to demonstrate that virtue promotes happiness.
- This comparison of Leibniz’s claims about disinterested love with his objections to Shaftesbury suggests that he has not explored the implications of his various views on pleasure and happiness. His opposition to Shaftesbury seems to refelct a hedonist and subjectivist conception that does not account for all of Leibniz’s claims and arguments about happiness. His arguments seem to bring him closer to the Aristotelian position on this question than his objections to Shaftesbury might would suggest.
