- Reciprocity of the virtues - each virtue requires each of the others
- Virtues not only necessary for happiness, but also are sufficient for happiness
- Excercizing Wisdom (Rational Control) = Happiness
- Rational Control is non-Instrumentally Good
- Virtue = Rational Control => Virtue is non-Instrumentally Good.
- Knowledge is sufficient for acting
- The Naturalism is true. Human functionis to be guided by practical reason
- Concept of assent
- We will accept some priority in justif i cation if we take virtuous actions to be justif i ed primarily as the product of virtues, and do not take virtues to be justif i ed primarily as the source of virtuous actions. But this claim about priority seems to be open to objection. If we have no independent reason to care about the actions resulting from the virtues, but we claim that the virtues are organized for the production of these actions, what reason have we to value the virtues? Critics of the Stoics often raise this objection
- Pain is not bad at all
- Stoics, like Skeptics, value tranquillity, but while Skeptics say that every tranquillity is happiness, stoics think that only proper tranquillity, achieved by a proper way, is the happiness
- Criticise Skeptics: When they say that the Sceptic will be inactive, they do not mean that he will be immobile, or that he will lack goal-directed behaviour. They mean that his goal-directed behaviour will not be rational action.
