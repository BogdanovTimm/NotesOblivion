- Aspasius emphasizes the connexion between the fineness and the praiseworthiness of virtue (in EN 32.11; cf. EN 1101b31–2). 
- In explaining how vice corrupts ethical principles, he suggests that it prevents us from recognizing that happiness consists in fine actions (in EN 136.19–23). Aristotle does not mention this particular effect of corruption (EN 1151a15); Aspasius probably mentions it because of his conviction that the f i ne is the goal of virtue. 
- When he considers how pain impedes the virtuous person’s actions, he emphasizes that it impedes fine actions (in En 150.15), though Aristotle does not say this in so many words (EN 1153b9–12).
