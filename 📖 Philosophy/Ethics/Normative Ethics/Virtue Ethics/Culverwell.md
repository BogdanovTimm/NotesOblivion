- Even Hobbes, who goes furthest in a voluntarist direction, believes that what fits human nature is independent of God’s legislative will; that is why the laws of nature are counsels of self-preservation. But Hobbes does not believe that God commands obedience to these natural laws because they preserve human society; the commands are not an exercise of God’s benevolence or of God’s care for creation, but of God’s power. Culverwell, Locke, Cumberland, and Pufendorf reject this part of Hobbes’s view; they agree that in some way God necessarily chooses to command observance of the natural law that preserves human society. On this point they agree with Suarez. They differ from Suarez, and from one another, in their views about whether the element of natural law that is independent of command and will is also morality. None of them defends Suarez’s combination of naturalism (about right and wrong) and voluntarism (about obligation and law).
