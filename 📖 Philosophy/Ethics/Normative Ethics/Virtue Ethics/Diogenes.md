- Virtue is sufficient for Happiness
- Hedonism is false
- Happiness = a freedom from unfulfilled desires (just like in Epicurean ethics)
- Virtues = integrity to ones own desires
- Low-cost fullfilmentvof desires are best than the High-cost ones

# Weaknesses

- Virtues are only means to the freedom of unfulfilled desires
