- Reciprocity of the virtues - each virtue requires each of the others (but, unlike in Socrayes, there are more than 1 virtue)
- Virtues are necessary for happiness (but not sufficient)
- Wisdom is not a one and only Instrumental Good, but it is not Happiness
- Virtue is non-instrumental good
- Virtue is not the only good.
- People may make mistajes because of non-ratiinal psrts of the soul
- Disagrees with both Cynics and Cyrenaics
- Says that Socrates' explanatory definitions and epistemological ones cant both be true at the same time, so, we must vhoose only one of them. He chooses explanatory one.
- Dedinitions of virtues:
    - Bravery is described as preservation of right belief under the control of the wisdom in the rational part; 
    - Temperance is concord between the parts under the control of the wisdom in the rational part.
    - Justice consists in each part (of the soul) doing its own work under the control of the wisdom in the rational part
    - Wisdom - knowledge of the Good
- Virtuous acts are virtuous because they are appropriately related to good order in the soul
- Moral Realist, Moral non-naturalist, non-reductive doctrine of the nature of moral properties
- Virtues are nit only about knowledge, but also abiut training non-rational parts of tge souk
- Structure of 
    - rational - the only one that strive to happiness
    - non-rational parts:
        - rational desires - desires that rest on reasoning. But not every reasoning, but of reasoning about the good for all other parts of the soul   
        - spirited desires - desires that display anger, pride, pity, self-esteem and  love of honour. But actually they displays desires that are based on some conceptions of Good and Evil, but not on Gooand and Evil for the whole soul. For example, even if I know this is not a good time to be angry, or that what you did is not important enough to be angry about, I may still be angry.
        - appetitive desires - desires that are just impulses towards certain satisfactions
- Different parts of soul has its own goals and time prolonged conceptions of themselves in relation to ration part (and hence they are agents, so, for example, they may regret about differentvthings: e.g missed pleasure)
 - If we assume something like Humean position: that the only mean of rational part of the siul is to choose best way to fulfill desires from non-rational part, then we make a mistake. And this explains incontinencs of a knowledge and action. So, Plato claims that the rational planing has a non-instrumental value.
- Rational part of the soul think about the good for all other parts, so, it is the best leader and ration
- To be virtuous = to choose right ends (happiness through rational planning) and strive to that end
- Justice must be chosen because of itself, not because it brings good consequencs
- Justice is needed for being happy
- Happiness is complete (includes all goods) and includes both virtues and exrernal goods
- Freedom from disturbance is not the good
- We have been given a good reason for being just if and only if we have been shown how justice promotes our happiness; he does not even consider the suggestion that we have overriding reason to be just even if justice does not promote our happiness
- Happiness consists in using practical reason to control the direction of one’s life.
- Philosopher will not want to rule the city, but we must compell them to do it. It may mean 2 either of 2 things:
    - The city compels the philosophers to have a less happy life than they would otherwise have, but it does not treat them unjustly
    - The city does not treat them unjustly and does not compel them to have a less happy life than they would otherwise have. Plato’s position is diff i cult to settle, because it is diff i cult to see which of these two answers he gives.
- Platonic love = when A shapes B to be virtues. Since A is concerned for B as a way of propagating A, and since A cares about A’s own interest for A’s own sake, A will also care about B for B’s own sake, not instrumentally to some further end.
- One's own interest is not not inconflict with others' interest: Hence we have reason to want to produce the cardinal virtues in other people too. But the cardinal virtues are the dominant element in everyone’s good. Hence virtuous agents—those who value the cardinal virtues in themselves—also achieve the good of others.
- Psychic justice = when non-rational parts of the soul are guided by tge rational one
- Virtue promotes happiness
- The best life is also the pleasantest life
- If we have one virtue we have all the virtues
- Virtue always promotes happiness more than vice does
- When people mistakes that do this because they take their ends from the non-rational parts of the soul. So, mere thinking of finding the most effective way to achieve ones desirea are not virtuous
- argue against the inference from variation to the rejection of objective goodness and rightness
- Moral judgements are objective
- Hedonism and moral virtues are incompatible
- Hedonism is false
