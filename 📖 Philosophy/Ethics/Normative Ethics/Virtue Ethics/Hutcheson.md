- Mistakely thinks that Aristotle thought that only virtue of character is a real virtue
- Only virtue of character is a real virtue
- The Naturalism is true. But human function consists not in being guided by practical reason
- Sentimentalism is true: the extent to which we are capable of sympathy defines the extent of concern.
- Extreme Will-Intellect-Passion Sentimentalism (thought can't motivate without desire) is true. In his view, reason moves us only in so far as it presents means to some independently-desired end; the fact that we desire a certain sort of object explains why other objects are worth choosing.
- Thought that Aristotle's and the Scholastics' rejection of an Extreme Will-Desire Intellectualism supports his (Hutcheson's) Extreme Will-Intellect-Passion Sentimentalism, because the only reasons are the internal ones
- The anti-rationalist position of Hutcheson claims that the different specific ends people pursue ref l ect their different desires, inclinations, and attitudes, and must ultimately be explained by these, rather than by their different rational beliefs about anything.
- Critiques Hobbes from sentimentalist point of view. According to sentimentalist critics, he has appealed to the wrong non-normative facts, because he is wrong about the motives that actually influence us. Hutcheson treats normative facts as facts about the reactions of our moral sense. 
- he denies a connexion between reason and morality
- defends independent morality by appealing to a moral sense. 
- He is naturalist about the relation of the divine will to morality, but he is sentimentalist about our knowledge of moral properties
- Hutcheson is a utilitarian, and tries to show that a moral sense theory is committed to utilitarianism. He agrees with Whewell in connecting a meta-ethical with a normative thesis, but the connexion is the opposite of the one that Whewell asserts. Whewell believes that a moral sense theory is an expression of belief in metaphysically independent morality that includes non-consequentialist morality; Hutcheson, however, believes that a moral sense theory supports utilitarian morality. He argues that it is permissible to harm some people in order to increase the happiness of others, and thereby to increase the total happiness.
- oppose theological voluntarism. 
- Later believers in a moral sense, Hume and Hutcheson, reject moral realism
- Some later critics treat Shaftesbury as the first sentimentalist. Hutcheson is the first of these critics; he designs his Inquiry as a defence of Shaftesbury’s principles.¹ The principles he defends are disinterested affection and a moral sense—two prominent themes in Shaftesbury’s defence of the moral outlook. 
- These claims about a moral sense allow objective moral properties. If we are immediately aware of them, they may still be aspects of ftiness to rational nature, as Suarez supposes. Shaftesbury’s suggestion that we have a natural sense of the honestum might indicate that he agrees with Suarez’s conception of the nature of moral properties. Belief in a moral sense conflicts with realism, however, if we hold a Lockean conception of a sense and its objects. According to Locke, or one common interpretation of Locke, senses whose objects are secondary qualities do not tell us about objective features of the world, but only about our own ideas. If Shaftesbury accepts a Lockean conception, his belief in a moral sense commits him to claims about moral knowledge that conflict with metaphysical realism about moral properties. But belief in a moral sense does not by itself require Lockean epistemological claims. As Reid points out later, belief in a moral sense does not push us towards realism or anti-realism until we decide how we are to conceive the relevant sort of sense.⁵³ Hutcheson makes up his mind on this question, by accepting a Lockean conception of a sense, and therefore rejecting realism about moral properties.⁵⁴
- In contrast to Fiddes, Hutcheson develops the psychological side of Shaftesbury’s argument. He believes he defends Shaftesbury’s realism by insisting on the irreducibility of moral properties and sentiments to Hobbesian self-interest. He relies on Shaftesbury’s defence of the moral sense against Hobbesian egoism, and formulates his account of the metaphysics and epistemology of morality on the basis of a Lockean account of the moral sense. This account requires the rejection of the metaphysical independence of moral properties from beliefs, sentiments, and legislation, and so abandons one aspect of Shaftesbury’s realism. 
- Hutcheson believes, as Cumberland and Shaftesbury do,¹ that Hobbes’s position undermines morality.² He agrees with Shaftesbury and Clarke in rejecting Cumberland’s and Locke’s view that morality consists in laws imposed by divine commands.³ In his view, we can understand moral obligation without reference to any law, by understanding our approval of benevolence. This approval is disinterested; Hutcheson rejects attempts to defend morality within the limits of a hedonist psychology. But he also rejects Clarke’s account of moral judgment and motivation as aspects of rational understanding grasping the fitness of things and properties. He reaches his own position by refelxion on his objections to Clarke.⁴ Hence he rejects the extreme rationalism of Clarke by insisting on a role for both reason and desire in moral motivation and justification. 
- In the Inquiry, therefore, Hutcheson supports Shaftesbury rather than Clarke. He undertakes to defend the principles of Shaftesbury against Mandeville, and to present the ideas of moral good and evil according to the views of ancient moralists.⁵
- Hutcheson defends Shaftesbury by rejecting all attempts to reduce moral judgments to calculations of self-interest. Against reductive views that treat moral judgment as the result of instrumental reasoning, he argues that some moral judgments are immediate judgments of a moral sense. This argument defends Shaftesbury’s ‘moral realism’ (though Hutcheson does not use Shaftesbury’s phrase). Shaftesbury follows traditional naturalists in claiming that the morally right (the honestum) is really distinct from the pleasant (dulce) and the advantageous (commodum, utile). Hutcheson is also a realist on this point. 
- The Inquiry also describes the content of our moral judgments. Hutcheson takes the basis of moral judgment to be utilitarian. His utilitarianism helps his anti-reductionism. For it is especially clear that utilitarian principles cannot be reduced to self-interested principles. If we are ultimately, and not just instrumentally, committed to utilitarian principles, our commitment is fundamentally disinterested. This utilitarian side of Hutcheson’s position goes beyond Shaftesbury and Cumberland, but Hutcheson might reasonably claim that it offers a further defence of their position. 
- In his late System of Moral Philosophy, he accepts or adapts several of Butler’s claims about conscience and moral judgment.⁸ Several of his arguments against the reductive aspects of Hobbes’s moral psychology are similar to Butler’s.
- Whewell’s view of Hutcheson as a philosopher of independent morality is open to question, however, insofar as Hutcheson is a utilitarian, and so makes morality ‘dependent’ on universal pleasure. Whewell takes opposition to utilitarianism to be one mark of independent morality, but he does not discuss Hutcheson’s elaborate statement of utilitarianism. He is right to connect Hutcheson’s defence of immediate and disinterested moral judgment with independent morality, though he argues that the introduction of a moral sense tends to compromise a defence of independent morality. Before
- Hutcheson follows Shaftesbury in rejecting Hobbes’s psychological hedonism. He denies that the desire for one’s own pleasure is the only ultimate non-rational desire, and so he rejects Hobbes’s view that both exciting and justifying reasons are ultimately derived from the desire for one’s own pleasure. But he believes Shaftesbury does not go far enough. He argues that Shaftesbury’s attempt to allow unselfish virtue within hedonist assumptions is not a defensible view of the relation between morality, desire, and pleasure.¹⁰ To derive our unselfsih motives from our desire for pleasure, we have to refelct on the remote and indirect consequences of our actions and motives. Such a refelxion, aided by the arguments of Cumberland and Pufendorf, might vindicate the cultivation of benevolence, but Hutcheson believes it is a wildly implausible explanation of our actual benevolent outlook. We do not need to be convinced by the conclusion of any complex prudential reasoning in order to feel and to approve benevolent motives.¹¹ 
- The next line of defence for psychological hedonism claims that moral goodness appeals to us not because its remoter consequences appear pleasant, but because it appears pleasant in its own right, apart from its consequences. Hutcheson answers that this hedonist argument is self-defeating, because our pleasure in virtuous action needs to be explained by an antecedent concern for virtuous action.¹² Pain in the absence of a desired object and pleasure in our success in getting it are the by-products of our desire for the object itself; they are not the objects of the desire.¹³ Though moral sentiments often cause pain and uneasiness, this feature of them does not support hedonism; for we would not be uneasy unless we objected, on some non-hedonist ground, to the situation that makes us uneasy. That is why we respond to our uneasiness by trying to get rid of the situation we object to, not by trying to remove our uneasiness at it. We do not, for instance, try to remove our uneasiness at someone’s distress by trying to care less about it; instead, we try to remove their distress.¹⁴ Our moral sentiments include pleasure and pain in certain situations, but they do not aim primarily at pleasure and the absence of pain.¹⁵ 
- In opposing indirect hedonism and egoism, Hutcheson also attacks Shaftesbury’s other opponents, the theological moralists who try to explain moral motivation by appeal to the desire for rewards and punishments. He argues that such motives cannot explain our admiration for morally good action. If we believed that virtuous people act entirely from the desire for further rewards after death, we would admire them no more than we admire people who do the right actions only for the sake of more immediate rewards.¹⁸ 
- Following Shaftesbury, he allows mixed motives, if the moral motive is sufficient for morally right action and the desire for reward is simply a further incentive.¹⁹ Still, simple desire for rewards cannot constitute a morally admirable motive by itself; our admiration presupposes some disinterested motive.²¹ 
- Hutcheson believes that psychological hedonism is false, because it gives a false account of other-regarding action. But, in contrast to Shaftesbury, he also rejects the traditional eudaemonist view that one’s happiness may include actions and states of character. He accepts prudential hedonism—the identification of one’s own good and one’s own happiness with pleasure.²² For a prudential hedonist, self-interested reasoning is about ways of maximizing pleasure; any aims that do not aim at maximizing my pleasure do not aim at my happiness or my good. 
- Since the Inquiry considers only egoism as a viable alternative, Hutcheson tends to speak as though we must believe in a moral sense if we are to allow disinterested action. This is how he presents the issue in his early essay on Mandeville. According to Mandeville, all apparently virtuous action is really self-interested, resulting from the desire for one’s own pleasure or for some means to it.³³ Hutcheson answers by defending ‘kind affections’ and a moral sense, without distinction.³⁴ We might suppose, therefore, that belief in a moral sense commits us only to recognition of disinterested action. But Hutcheson intends more than this; he also means to assimilate moral judgments to the senses rather than reason. 
- He connects the immediacy of moral judgments with their passivity. We seem to receive them from external reality just as we receive ideas of sensory qualities.³⁵We
- According to Hobbes, morality accords with human nature only in the specific circumstances of the commonwealth. Hutcheson argues that even when circumstances do not make morality beneficial for us (conceiving our benefit in a self-confined sense), morality is still in accord with human nature. Hutcheson answers Hobbesby appealing to our actual desires and motives, and specifcially to sympathy and benevolence, to show that, apart from our selfsih advantage, we still have a motive that is strong enough to move us to act morally. He accepts Hobbes’s view about what makes something natural; for he argues that we often have a predominant desire to do what is morally right, even apart from any further benefti we gain from it. 
- Since morality has this natural basis, theological voluntarists are wrong to identify moral rightness with conformity to the divine will or divine legislation.⁴⁰ God’s arbitrary will and inclination does not make it right to do what promotes the good of humanity. Voluntarism gives a false account of moral knowledge and motivation. In order to know what is morally right, we ought not to ask simply what God requires; nor ought we to act simply out of a desire to conform to divine commands. We should rely on our moral sense, and on unselfish motivation. 
- Since voluntarism is mistaken, we should also recognize a natural law antecedent to any positive legislation by God or by human legislators. The first principles of natural law are eternal and immutable, and natural law imposes obligations even in the state of nature.⁴¹ Nor are they the result of the arbitrary choice of God and the exercise of divine power. God does not create goodness by arbitrary will; God is necessarily good, and therefore benevolent. Hence God approves of some actions rather than others because they benefit humanity.⁴² God’s goodness ultimately explains our having our moral sense; for since it is good for humanity that we are benevolent and approve benevolence, God, being benevolent, gives us a moral sense that approves of benevolent action.⁴³ Hutcheson combines Shaftesbury’s opposition to voluntarism with his own views about the moral sense and benevolence. 
- Hutcheson emphasizes benevolence among God’s attributes, and infers that we have to attribute something like the moral sense to God: ‘ . . . if we can in any way reason concerning the original nature from what we feel in our own, or from any of our notions of excellency or perfection, we must conceive in a Deity some perceptive power analogous to our moral sense, by which he may have self-approbation in certain affections and actions . . .







#                  Difficulties

- Hutcheson takes a step that Shaftesbury does not take, by defniing moral goodness as essentially what is approved by the moral sense. He takes the moral sense to be disinterested, and therefore he supposes that he defends Shaftesbury. This interpretation of the moral sense and its relation to moral goodness is also Berkeley’s interpretation of Shaftesbury, and it is the basis for Berkeley’s criticism.⁵⁷ But Hutcheson overlooks the fact that he defends only the motivational part of Shaftesbury’s realist doctrine, and that he undermines the metaphysical part. Balguy points out this consequence of Hutcheson’s modification of Shaftesbury; he shows that Hutcheson’s position exposes him to Shaftesbury’s argument against theological voluntarism.⁵⁸ 
- Hutcheson’s indirect utilitarian defence of more specific principles and traits suggests that we need not face the uncertainties of calculating utility on every occasion on which we have to decide what it is right to do.⁴⁴ But one may doubt whether the indirect utilitarian defence succeeds, if it is applied to the specifci rules and traits that Clarke takes to be clearly right. 
- Prudential hedonism, however, does not seem plausible without psychological hedonism.²³ It seems arbitrary to identify one’s own good with pleasure, and to ignore the objects apart from pleasure that we recognize as possible objects of pursuit. Hutcheson does not explain why he accepts prudential hedonism. He argues that our moral sentiments and moral sense are not expressions of desires for our own pleasure, and he infers that they are not self-interested desires. He assumes that psychological egoism collapses with psychological hedonism. Similarly, he assumes that the supremacy of the desire for one’s own happiness would imply the supremacy of a selfish desire. This assumption makes it difficult for him to understand the eudaemonism of the ancient moralists. He interprets it in two different ways: (1) He suggest that eudaemonists recognize unselfish desires not arising from self-love, but ‘subject’ these desires to the selfish desire for one’s own pleasure.²⁴ (2) He suggests that the ancients treat the desire for one’s own happiness as the starting-point of action, from which we may develop desires that are not focussed on happiness. In his support he appeals to their views on friendship and on patriotism.²⁵ He acknowledges that eudaemonist views, whichever way we interpret them, do not deny unselfish desire and action. But he still assumes that their conception of the ultimate end is selfish. He overlooks the possibility that some of the ends of unselfish affections are parts of perfection and happiness, not simply means to it; for he assumes that if the ‘kind’ affections are subordinate to happiness, they are subordinate to an essentially selfsih end. He maintains that moral sentiments are independent of our desire for our own happiness; but, given the possibility of non-hedonistic eudaemonism, his argument against psychological hedonism does not rule out every egoist account of the basis of morality.²⁶ 
- If moral reasons are not derived from self-interest, they must provide suffciient reasons by themselves, without reference to any more ultimate reasons. Our recognition, for instance, that this action promotes the public good must provide—in conjunction with the relevant desire—a reason for doing it, without appeal to any further self-interested consideration. But a simple desire for the good of others for their own sake does not make someone morally good. Even if such a desire is entirely non-self-regarding, we could have it without approving of our action. It is characteristic of a morally good person, however, to approve of this desire, whether in himself or in someone else; that is the essentially reflexive element of morality. To make a moral judgment on an action is not simply to add another desire to our initial desire to do the action; it is to express the view that this desire is right and appropriate for an agent in these circumstances. A rationalist might accept these arguments. If promotion of the public good is a sufficient justification and admits no further justification, perhaps reason recognizes this justification.²⁷ Similarly, the reflexive character of moral judgment may result from rational recognition of the appropriate desire.²⁸ Hutcheson, however, believes that his arguments against psychological egoism also refute rationalism. Our moral judgments do not rest on reasoning about consequences because they do not rest on reasoning at all; they are too immediate to be the product of reasoning. If we had to depend on reason, our moral judgments would be wavering and unreliable. God’s goodness provides us with a moral sense, so that we are not left to work out the right actions by our limited rational capacities.²⁹ If we are as acute as Cumberland and Pufendorf, reflexion on our own advantage will lead us to the actions that the moral sense approves; but the moral sense, directly approving benevolent actions, reaches the same conclusion more immediately and reliably.³⁰ This argument for the moral sense as opposed to reason, directly addresses only those opponents who identify reason with strictly self-interested calculation. ³¹ Hutcheson assumes that moral properties can be matters for rational judgments only if they are found to promote one’s self-interest.³² But his observations on the immediacy of moral judgments could also be used against opponents who treat them as the product of non-egoistic reasoning. Hutcheson legitimately insists that any adequate account of moral judgments has to explain their immediacy. But this requirement does not rule out all rationalist views known to Hutcheson. The appeal to immediacy does not seem to count against Clarke’s views. For Clarke does not believe that moral judgments are rational because they are the conclusions of complex calculations of self-interest, or because they depend on any other complicated process of reasoning. As he points out, many mathematical and logical judgments appear to be immediate, but do not seem to belong to a sense.
- Not every sort of sensory awareness, however, includes detection of external reality. Hutcheson argues that beauty is an idea ‘raised in us’ by objects (IB 1.9 = L 23), to which nothing similar in the objects corresponds. If we recognize beauty in an object we are aware of objective properties of it, such as order, symmetry, and proportion; but though these properties give us the idea of beauty, they are not the beauty in the object.³⁷ A subjectivist analysis would cast doubt on part of Shaftesbury’s defence of his ‘moral realist’ view that moral properties are aspects of reality and not simply creations of our minds through choices, desires, or legislation. The Inquiry does not show what Hutcheson thinks about this part of Shaftesbury’s position. He does not discuss the conflict between Shaftesbury’s aims, which he shares, and the result he has reached.³⁸
- One might argue if his account of the moral sense reaches a subjectivist conclusion, one ought to consider whether (The Inquiry does not pursue these questions any further. Though Hutcheson seems to commit himself to a subjectivist account of the moral sense, he does not develop such an account):
    - something is wrong with his account of a sense 
    - he has applied this account wrongly to the moral sense. If we reject the frist and second possibilities, and we believe that a realist position is plausible, we may find the third possibility attractive. 
    - he is wrong to claim that we are aware of moral properties by a moral sense. 
    - Though Shaftesbury anticipates Hutcheson in speaking of a moral sense, his remarks on the sense of right and wrong do not deny that moral judgment is rational; they simply seem to assert that we have some immediate and disinterested grasp of moral goodness. But Hutcheson goes further than Shaftesbury on this point; for he intends his doctrine of a moral sense to refute a rationalist account of moral judgment. We might suppose that he simply means his anti-rationalism to rule out an indirect egoist account of moral judgment. Perhaps he means only that moral judgment is not based on reasoning about good consequences for oneself. If that is all he means, he does not exclude the possibility that moral judgment is based on, or incorporates, some different exercise of reason. But he never recognizes this possibility. The reason for his failure to recognize it becomes clear in the Illustrations, where he expands his account of the moral sense in relation to some of Hobbes’s and Locke’s views on action and motivation.⁴⁴ 
    - Hobbes’s account of morality rests on his moral psychology, and in particular on his conception of practical reason. He denies that practical reason is the source of any distinctive ends; its only function is to fnid means to ends that are independently fxied by non-rational desires.⁴⁵ Locke and Hutcheson develop this Hobbesian view. We have found it useful, in discussing both the mediaeval disputes and the dispute between Hobbes and Bramhall, to distinguish intellectualism (the view that action depends primarily on intellect rather than will) from rationalism (the view that action depends on passion rather than rational will). Aquinas is a moderate intellectualist, but also a rationalist, whereas Scotus is both a voluntarist and a rationalist. Hobbes’s discussion does not distinguish the two positions, and on this point Locke and Hutcheson follow him.
