- Hedonism is true
- Momentary pleasure is a non-instrumental value
- Happiness = long-term pleasures
- Happinness are not final good
- Current pleasure is the final good
- The desire is the basis of our reasons - if I care about something - it is reasonable to care about it. So, if I care about happiness - it is reasonable for me to care about it.
