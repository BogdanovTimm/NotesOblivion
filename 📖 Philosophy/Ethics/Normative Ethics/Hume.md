- Role of a rational part of the soul is only an instrumental one
- It is not rational to plan the better way of fullfilling the desire
- Rejects the supremacy of reasons based on one’s own good for being moral
- Holistic Naturalism (Human nature os a system of some tendencies of people. But not all tendencies are part of human nature) is false. Hume does not believe that all claims about human nature must be excluded from moral philosophy, but he rejects the naturalist position that we have outlined. Everything whar people do is a human's nature
- Hume anticipates many of Nietzsche’s alleged ‘insights’; he attacks emphasis on ‘morality’ and responsibility without even knowing about Kant, who is a primary target of Nietzsche, MacIntyre, and Williams.
- Virtues of character are sufficient to be virtuous
- In unself i sh concern A wants to do x for B, simply because B wants x done or because it would be better for B, not because A gains any further benef i t from doing x. A shows this concern for B if A moves to one side to avoid walking over B’s gouty toes, when A has nothing else to gain by doing this. This is the unself i sh sentiment whose reality Hume (e.g.) defend against the psychological egoism of Hobbes
- In his view, the difference between simply entertaining a proposition and believing it consists in the degree of vividness with which you entertain it; it is an introspectible property of the idea itself.
- He argues that the attempt to f i nd a rational basis for moral beliefs is a philosophical undertaking whose failure makes no difference to the ordinary way we hold our beliefs. Just as our belief that the sun will rise tomorrow is undisturbed even when we see that it lacks rational justif i cation, our moral sentiments are unaffected even when we see that they lack rational foundation.
- Sentimentalism is true: the extent to which we are capable of sympathy defines the extent of concern.
- The anti-rationalist position of Hutcheson claims that the different specific ends people pursue reflect their different desires, inclinations, and attitudes, and must ultimately be explained by these, rather than by their different rational beliefs about anything.
- Hume accepts compatibilism, but does not believe that it removes objections to predestination. 
- false judgments cannot be the source of immorality
- freedom consists simply in internal determination; he sees no relevant distinction between the will and the ‘sentiments’ or ‘passions’ as sources of the internal determination.
He rejects both an indeterminist and an intellectualist account of freedom.¹⁸ Though he accepts the voluntarist criticisms of intellectualism far enough to believe that determination by intellect is not freedom, he does not regard voluntarism as an adequate alternative.
Against both intellectualists and voluntarists, he concludes that the will is a passion. 
- Hume’s argument about ‘is’ and ‘ought’:
we have given the wrong account of a moral judgment if our account allows someone to believe that a moral judgment is true without having any motive to act on it.
- Hume believes that justice is appropriate only in specific external circumstances that do not follow from human nature itself.⁷⁰ The competition that leads to a state of war results from human nature only in conditions of scarcity. 
- Hume intends his moral sense theory to express anti-realism and the rejection of independent morality. HE believes that he continues and develops Hutcheson’s approach to morality, and especially his account of the moral sense
- oppose theological voluntarism. 
- Later believers in a moral sense, Hume and Hutcheson, reject moral realism
- Since the only intelligible account of moral properties makes them dependent on the reactions of the moral sense, our view that they are non-arbitrary and immutable in certain ways turns out to be unjustified.⁵⁶
- Balguy’s criticism of Hutcheson convinces not only Butler and Price, but also Hume.
For Hume implicitly agrees that Hutcheson cannot combine his sentimentalist objections to Clarke with his realist defence of Shaftesbury, because his sentimentalism conflicts with realism. Butler and Price argue that in the face of this we should give up sentimentalism, but Hume decides to give up realism instead.
- Both Hume and Price notice that Hutcheson’s position on authority is unsatisfactory. In Hume’s view, the concession to Butler is a mistake. In Price’s view, Hutcheson is right to agree with Butler, but wrong to suppose that the moral sense meets Butler’s conditions for an authoritative principle.²⁰ Both critics argue, from their opposite points of view, that Hutcheson can restore consistency to his position only by moving either to a more rationalist or to a more anti-rationalist view.
- The normative pretensions of previous moral philosophy appear to Hume to be misguided. But why does he think so? In claiming that the science of man allows us to ‘conquer’ the sciences that more intimately concern human life, he might mean that the experimental study of human nature provides a basis for better-founded normative claims about how human beings ought to be. Alternatively, he might mean that experimental study conquers moral philosophy by expelling the normative element that is distinct from experimental study. We need to see which of these two views expresses Hume’s claim about the significance of experimental moral science.
- Sometimes, however, Hume attacks the basis of common-sense beliefs. His discussion of induction seems to affect the rational basis of all our beliefs about ‘matters of fact’. His argument about personal identity seems to attack not only metaphysical theories of personal identity, but also the belief that I am the same person through the normal changes in my mental states. Similarly, the sceptical discussion of the senses casts doubt on both the vulgar belief and the more circumspect (as Hume supposes) philosophical belief in external objects.
Hume takes his scepticism to be pervasive, since it shows that our beliefs about causes and effects and our beliefs about external objects undermine each other (i 4.7, 4). But we cannot give up either of these sets of beliefs.
- If Hume’s premisses seem to lead by valid arguments to absurd conclusions, ought we to doubt the truth of his premisses? Hume does not think so. In his view, sceptical philosophy and common sense are in permanent tension. Sceptical arguments encourage him to reject all beliefs.⁵ Common life does not refute the sceptical arguments, but it weakens their influence.
Since we have to act, we cannot (he claims) maintain complete suspension of belief.
Still, sceptical philosophy changes our attitude to our common-sense beliefs. If we are sceptics, we recognize that we hold our ordinary beliefs because they are entrenched and we cannot easily get rid of them, not because we think the evidence warrants them.⁶ This is not our normal attitude—before we become sceptics—to our everyday beliefs. If we agree with Hume that sceptical arguments undermine the justification of everyday beliefs, we cannot turn our back on sceptical conclusions when we engage in the activities of everyday life.
- A sceptical point of view does not undermine every impulse to philosophical inquiry, but it changes the character of the inquiry. If we are sceptics, we ask psychological rather than normative questions. Instead of asking what is morally good or bad, we ask what causes us to judge one thing good and another bad. 
- The experimental method allows us to construct this science of man that makes no claims about ultimate reality, and does not go beyond the ordinary claims of common life. Even if we are sceptics about the objective truth of claims about the world, our scepticism does not spread to claims about our propensities and tendencies. For the relevant claims belong to the science of human nature, which survives Hume’s sceptical doubts.⁹ 
- Is Hume entitled to assume that the ‘pre-sceptical’ science of human nature that we use to argue for sceptical conclusions is the same science as the ‘post-sceptical’ science that investigates the questions that survive sceptical conclusions? In his view, the pre-sceptical and the post-sceptical science are the same, because each is an empirical investigation of human abilities. Past philosophers have told us that we can know the world as it really is; in order to know it, we need certain cognitive capacities. The pre-sceptical science of human nature assures us that we lack these capacities, so that it is futile to seek knowledge of the world as it really is. But since the science of human nature tells us about our capacities, we can continue asking about our capacities even when we realize we cannot learn about the world as it really is. The psychological investigation of human capacities—both pre-sceptical and post-sceptical—is not a normative inquiry, and it does not try to answer normative questions about whether we are justified in believing in causes, or necessary connexion, or an external world. 
- This description shows that the science of man is insufficient for Hume’s sceptical conclusions. In Book i his case for scepticism depends on his claims about the cognitive capacities we need in order to acquire knowledge of the world as it is. He claims, for instance, that if we are justified in believing that causal connexions in the world are more than constant conjunctions, we need an impression of necessary connexion in the world.
Psychological inquiry shows us (in his view) that we have no such impression. But some argument going beyond psychological inquiry is needed to show that we need such an impression if we are to believe justifiably in causation. Such argument seems to belong to metaphysics and epistemology. Hence the discipline that Hume practises in order to reach sceptical conclusions does not seem to be the purely psychological science of human nature that answers his post-sceptical questions.
The purely psychological science of human nature, therefore, cannot assure us that the only questions worth asking are those that this science of human nature can answer. To convince ourselves to restrict our questions to the science of human nature, we need arguments in metaphysics and epistemology. 
- Rationalism and objectivism, the two positions that he rejects, imply that moral judgments express knowledge of an objective reality. 
- Hume believes that, once we consider our reasoning capacities and the character of our moral judgments, we can see that we lack the sort of access to objective moral properties that we would need if we were entitled to make objectivist claims. Experimental science of human nature shows us that we lack the capacity to find eternal fitnesses, just as we lack the capacity to find objective causal relations.
The refutation of these objectivist philosophical theories of morality does not, in Hume’s view, imply any doubt about morality itself. On the contrary, we may find it reassuring and clarifying to recognize that our moral judgments do not collapse in the face of a refutation of philosophicaltheoriesthatprofesstofindsomedeeperfoundationforthem.Sincethetheories are controversial, it is a good thing that our moral judgments do not rely on their truth.
- Hume’s attitude is more similar to Machiavelli’s view that the ‘monkish’ mediaeval moralists have corrupted the sound morality of pagan antiquity.¹⁸ In this contrast between healthy paganism and the errors introduced by mediaeval Christianity, Hume anticipates Hegel and Nietzsche. But he differs from them about where to find the healthy paganism. Hume finds it in Hellenistic ethics, and specifically in Cicero’s account ofit. Heshowsvery littleacquaintancewiththeethical viewsofPlatoandAristotle. 
- Hume’s claims about what the ancients say and mean are brief, but significant; they sketch some of the main features of his own position. He suggests that if we practise the science of man, we will take an experimental approach to human nature, we will be anti-rationalists about action and virtue, and we will abandon the normative pretensions of moral philosophy, both in our claims about human nature and in our claims about the virtues.  
- Hume draws one of his sharpest contrasts between the ancients and the ‘monkish’ writers in discussing the claim that the moral virtues are voluntary states. He believes that this claim reflects ignorance of the experimental method. It introduces an unprofitable dispute that can be resolved by attention to facts about human nature. In Hume’s view, the ancients are right to avoid this dispute, because they do not separate moral from non-moral virtues. A dispute about which virtues are strictly moral is purely verbal. No significant issue rests on a sharp division between genuine moral virtues and other qualities that we may find attractive or admirable to some degree.
In taking this position Hume disagrees not only with earlier Christian moralists, but apparently also with Hutcheson. In Hutcheson’s view, the distinctively moral virtues must be founded on benevolence, and he criticizes Hume for allowing natural abilities and other non-voluntary states unrelated to benevolence to count as virtues. Hume takes this to be an artificial and misleading restriction of ‘virtue’.²⁴
- At first sight, Hutcheson and Hume agree with Butler in believing that morality is natural, but reject his belief that morality is rational. They deny that moral judgments and sentiments are simply devices to secure the self-interest of Hobbesian agents; they take morality to have a broader foundation in the operations of human nature and human mental life in general.
Hume, agreeing with Hutcheson, accepts Butler’s objections to psychological hedonist egoism,⁴³ and treats Butler’s argument as an example of the ways in which philosophical investigation of human nature can lead to a more accurate understanding of the basis of morality. 
- But even if Hume agrees with Butler’s claim that some actions are naturally appropriate for a human being, he disagrees about which actions these are. In Butler’s view, two claims about naturalness are closely connected: (1) What is natural for a human being is what is appropriate for the whole system that constitutes a human being. (2) For a human being as a rational agent, it is appropriate to act in accordance with superior principles appealing to authority rather than strength. Hume accepts neither of these claims.
Butler’s first claim assumes that a human being is a system, as opposed to a collection or aggregate of traits, capacities, and desires. We must recognize this system before we can identify principles that aim at the good of the system as a whole. But some of Hume’s other claims commit him to the denial of this belief in a system. According to Hume, a human self is simply a collection of mental states and episodes, no subset of which constitutes the essential or fundamental self. We cannot consider or protect the fundamental persistent characteristics of the numerically identical self, since there is no such self and there are no such characteristics.
Perhaps we ought not to introduce Hume’s sceptical arguments about personal identity.
He does not suggest that his arguments in moral philosophy presuppose his scepticism about personal identity. On the contrary, he allows that the idea of the self accompanies many passions.⁵⁷ But he does not make any of the claims about a person as a system that support Butler’s claims about natural action. He may recognize that Butler’s view involves claims about the self that are too robust for Hume’s position.⁵⁸ Since Hume rejects Butler’s claims about the self, he also rejects Butler’s precise distinction between rational self-love and the particular passions. Though he accepts a part of Butler’s argument in favour of benevolence (IPM 9.20),⁵⁹ he omits Butler’s claim that self-love is concerned with the whole self as opposed to particular objects of desire. The deliberations of self-love seem to assume something like Butler’s conception of its aim and object.⁶⁰ But Hume’s outlook leaves no room for such a conception. He needs to explain self-love with reference to the agent’s predominant desires, not with reference to the whole self.⁶¹
- Hume explicitly disagrees with Hutcheson on the authority of conscience;⁶³ he implicitly disagrees with him on the rationality of prudence. According to Hume, reason does not guide us to act in accordance with human nature. None of the distinctive operations that Butler attributes to self-love is especially characteristic of reason. Hence, it is not distinctively rational to take the point of view of self-love. For Butler, rational self-love has special insight into what is required for the benefit of the system that constitutes human nature. For Hume, there is no such system, and there is no distinctively rational self-love. Even if our nature requires certain kinds of actions, reason gives us no special access to them. In disagreeing with Butler about reason and natural action, Hume relies on his treatment of passion and reason. 
- Hume agrees with Hobbes in rejecting the division between passion and will. He sees that if we reject this division, we undermine Hobbes’s belief in a special connexion between practical reason, will, and concern for one’s overall good. Hobbes’s belief is a Scholastic remnant, conflicting with the rest of Hobbes’s position. Hume removes the conflict.
Hisanalysisofthepassionseliminatestheaspectsofapassionthat allowrationalevaluation and guidance. Aquinas believes that a passion is tractable because it includes an appearance of the goodness of its object, even though it does not rest on a belief about universal good.
Hobbes retains this feature of Aquinas’ account, since he takes each passion to involve its distinctive form of appetite or aversion, and therefore its distinctive view of something as good or bad (L. 6.2, 7). Hume, however, separates the passion from any appearance of goodness, taking the relation to be purely contingent. This aspect of his analysis explains some of his most surprising claims about the passions and their objects 
- Hume distinguishes the cause from the object of a given passion, and within the cause he further distinguishes the subject and the quality (T ii 1.2.6).⁴ Since he takes causal relations to hold between ‘objects’, usually understood as events, we might take the subject (for instance, a house) and its quality (splendour) to be different constituents of the event that is the cause. Perhaps the object is a state of affairs or fact, so that I take pride in, say, the fact that I have a splendid house, or in my having a splendid house.
But when he speaks of the object of a passion, Hume does not refer to anything as complex as a fact or state of affairs. He seems to refer to the particular item in the world to which one’s passion is directed. Hence he takes pride and humility to have the same object, oneself.⁵ If we identified the cause with the object (as Hume understands ‘object’), and distinguished passions by their objects, we would have to say that pride and humility are the same passion, because they have the same object. They are different, however, because they have different causes. Hume does not consider a description of the object of pride as ‘something good about myself’ or ‘the fact that I am suitably connected to something good’, or a suitably different description of humility. 
- Hume’s views about the individuation of passions, and their logical independence from causes and objects, are even clearer from some of his remarks about love and hatred. In his view, benevolence and anger are only contingently accompanied by love and hatred, ‘by the original constitution of the mind’ (ii 2.6 6). The relation that actually holds between love and benevolence ‘abstractly considered, is not necessary’, because the sensations of love and hatred could have existed without any desire, or connected with the opposite desires.⁸ This division between the sensation and the desire implies that the sensation is the essential feature of the passion, contingently connected with the desire. This same view explains why passions are only contingently associated with their objects and causes.⁹ According to this view, the sensation that we now have when we wish well to other people would still be love if it were conjoined with a desire to harm them or with complete indifference to their interests.
Hume may be right to claim that the sensation is part of the passion. The mere desire to benefit others is not enough for the passion of love, since we might have the desire for various reasons that would not cause the passion. But it does not follow that the desire is inessential to the passion. Hume’s claim that the sensation is logically separable from the desire does not justify his claim that the mere sensation is the passion. 
- Hume cannot allow this criticism of a passion, if the appearance of goodness is not an essential property of the passion itself, but simply part of the cause. Since beliefs can affect passions, the recognition that I have nothing to be proud of may cause me to abandon the passion.¹¹ But my recognition does not warrant criticism of my pride, since the belief or appearance of something to be proud of is not essential to the passion. The passion may be modified if we no longer attribute the property we used to attribute to its cause; but this is not criticism of the passion, but simply manipulation of it. Since the appearance of goodness is not part of the passion, an unreasonable or foolish appearance does not make a passion unreasonable or foolish. 
- Hume’s account of the passions, therefore, leaves open the possibility of causal influence, rather than rational criticism and evaluation, by the rational will.¹² But Hume does not exploit this possibility, since he does not separate the rational will from the passions; he argues that the will is a passion, with no essential connexion to practical reason. This is Hume’s version of Hobbes’s claim that the will is simply the last appetite in deliberation.
Hume’s version rests on a more precise account of a passion.
Hume takes himself to oppose a widespread view about the role of practical reason.¹³ Though he does not mention Hutcheson, he defends Hutcheson’s view that neither exciting nor justifying reasons can be derived from reason. But in contrast to Hutcheson, Hume suggests that his view ‘may appear somewhat extraordinary’ (ii 3.3.4).¹⁴ He presents himself as an innovator challenging a consensus in favour of rationalism. Hutcheson, however, believes that this anti-rationalist view simply reasserts a Scholastic and Aristotelian view against modern rationalists.¹⁵ 
- Hume needs to defend two claims: (1) The source of justifying and exciting reasons is not reason itself. (2) The source is passion. To reach the second claim from the first we must assume that the only two conceivable ‘influencing motives of the will’ are passion and reason, and that if reason fails, only passion is left. Hume assumes this; he devotes his efforts to a defence of his first claim, and says little to defend the dichotomy that underlies the second claim.¹⁹ The assumptions that support the dichotomy are doubtful. Aquinas, for instance, believes that reason does not move us by itself, but does not infer that passion must be the only mover; for will, as Aquinas conceives it, is neither reason nor passion. If Hume conceives reason broadly, perhaps Aquinas’ position fits into his dichotomy; but then we may need to reconsider the soundness of his argument to show that reason does not give us justifying or exciting reasons. What, then, does Hume mean by his first claim, and how does he defend it? 
- To show that reason cannot provide justifying or exciting reasons, Hume claims to describe all the functions of reason, and then points out that these functions do not include exciting or justifying reasons.²⁰ He allows only two functions: (a) Reason points out that a desire rests on some false supposition, so that I desire x as F (F is x’s desirability-characteristic), and reason points out to me that x is not F. (b) Reason points out to me that a desire for x as a means to y rests on a false supposition that x is in fact a means sufficient for y. The second function of reason is an instance of the first, informing me that the object of my desire lacks some feature that I thought it had, and that was the basis of my desiring it. Hume does not imply that whenever reason informs me that I have made a mistake about the properties of x, my desire for x will go away. He implies that if I thought x was G, discover that it is not G, but still desire it, then I did not desire x as G.²¹
- What sorts of reasons does Hume’s argument cover? Hutcheson argues: (1) Reason provides no exciting reason; every action is caused by some desire that is independent of reason. (2) Reason provides no justifying reason: appeal to reason cannot show that one action deserves approval over another (except within the limits fixed by the functions of reason). Hume agrees with Hutcheson on exciting reasons, since he claims that ‘reason alone can never be a motive to any action of the will’. He also seems to agree on justifying reasons. His claim that reason ‘can never oppose passion in the direction of the will’ includes justifying reasons, if ‘direction’ refers to prescriptions as well as to actual motivation.
Moreover, Hume’s account of the functions of reason undermines a justifying as well as an exciting role for reason alone.²² In saying that what reason alone tells us cannot ‘concern’ us without some presupposed desire, he refers implicitly to justifying reasons. In saying that a desire must be presupposed before the objects of reason are ‘able to affect us’, he refers to exciting reasons.²³ If Hume has identified the only two possible functions of reason, he has shown why Hutcheson is right: (1) Reason cannot by itself provide exciting reasons, since the two kinds of reasoning Hume recognizes cannot themselves motivate without some antecedent desire for an end about which reason discovers these facts. Simply discovering that x is F, or that x is a sufficient means to y does not move me to pursue x unless I already care about x’s being F or being a means to y. (2) Nor can reason by itself provide justifying reasons; for the information that reason gives does not show that this or that action deserves to be approved.
If I find that x is a sufficient means to y, I still have no justifying reason to approve x, unless I already want y. If reason supports my approval of x, I presuppose some prior approval of y, resting on some desire for y as an end or on some approval of y that in turn rests on a desire for some further end.

If reason supports my approval of x, I presuppose some prior approval of y, resting on some desire for y as an end or on some approval of y that in turn rests on a desire for some further end.
The narrow scope of reason implies that reason can prescribe neither the choice of an end nor the choice of the best means to an end. If I could book a flight from New York to London on one airline for $600 and on another airline for $700, and the two flights and airlines are otherwise equal, reason, as Hume understands it, is indifferent between them.
Hume is right, given his view of the functions of reason, to deny that the preference for efficiency is rational. The choice of the best and most efficient means presupposes some preference for prudence and foresight, but this preference is not based on reason. 
- Hume does not deny that we might have a desire directed towards our longer-term rather than our shorter-term interest; we must have such a desire if we ever prefer the scratching of our finger to the destruction of the world. But he maintains that this is not a distinctively rational desire.
- Reason, therefore, cannot provide justifying reasons for the pursuit of one end over another.²⁴ Hume recognizes ‘the maxims of common prudence and discretion’ that advise us on how to achieve our various ends, by identifying instrumental means to them. But he argues that reason can provide nothing more.²⁵ The Sceptic claims that reason is incapable of discovering that anything is valuable in itself, and hence of justifying any ultimate ends.²⁶ He defends his claims about ultimate ends, first from ‘diversity of sentiment’, and then from the arguments in the Treatise about the source of moral distinctions. Hume’s discussions of reason and passion and of moral distinctions have the common aim of undermining the conception of the philosopher as a ‘cunning man’ who can tell us which ends are worth pursuing, independently of whether we already pursue them or not. In denying that the philosopher is a ‘cunning man’, Hume denies that reason can provide justifying reasons independent of antecedent passions. 
- Hume makes clear a point that Hutcheson leaves implicit, that he intends to go beyond Aristotle’sclaimthatthoughtdoesnotmoveuswithoutdesire.⁴⁴Inrejectingpurerationalism about motivation Aristotle agrees with Hume that reason by itself cannot move us to action without desire; but he does not say that the desire that needs to be added to reason is desire that is independent of reason. The desire that Aristotle adds to reason is the desire for happiness, which is an essentially rational desire, open to modification through reflexion on the good. This sort of desire presupposes functions for practical reason that Hume denies.
And so Hume’s denial that reason provides exciting reasons is more extreme than the apparently similar claims of Aristotle and Aquinas. He does not mean only that reason needs desire before we are moved to action; he also claims that the only source of motivation is desire without reason. In his view, a practical reason cannot modify a desire for an end, because the functions of reason do not apply to desire for ends. His claim about exciting reasons rests on his account of the functions of reason; but we have seen that this account does not refute Butler’s position. 
- The Treatise appears to accept hard determinism, since it defends a doctrine of necessity and determinism that Hume takes to conflict with a belief in liberty. The Inquiry takes a compatibilist position, claiming that liberty, on any reasonable understanding of it, is not ruled out by necessity, on any reasonable understanding of it.⁴⁶ 
- Hume implicitly acknowledges that one might defend a doctrine of liberty as spontaneity without indifference, but he develops this point only in the Inquiry.⁴⁸ 
- Even in the Treatise, where he is an incompatibilist about determinism and freedom, he is a compatibilist about determinism and responsibility. In his view, to be responsible is to be an object of moral sentiments, and in particular of praise, blame, gratitude, anger, love, hatred. Determinism does not undermine these sentiments; indeed, we cannot be objects of these sentiments unless our characters and dispositions causally determine our actions (T ii 3.2.6). 
- his claim that actions ‘out of character’ are not objects of praise and blame. The criticism is especially justified given that he claims to describe our actual reactions, not to tell us what reactions we ought to have. 
- change of character removes responsibility for past actions. 
- Hume takes his practical argument to undermine every purely cognitive view of morality.
He mentions three claims: (1) Virtue is ‘nothing but a conformity to reason’. (2) There are eternal fitnesses that ‘are the same to every rational being that considers them’. (3) Right and wrong impose an obligation on God as well as on human beings.³ Hume speaks as though he is considering only views that treat moral judgments as a priori knowledge of ‘relations of ideas’ (as Hume calls them). Clarke and Price hold such views, but it is not clear that Butler agrees with them. Hume’s argument is not confined, however, to conceptions of moral judgments as a priori; it seems to extend to all purely cognitive views (iii 1.1.26). According to such views, we can know that an action is right or wrong by knowing some fact about the world that is not constituted by the thoughts or feelings of the subject who knows. 
- But even if Hume’s objection rests on a dubious assumption, it may still expose a flaw in Clarke’s rationalism. To meet Hume’s objection, we need to maintain that the relation of ingratitude that holds between voluntary agents is crucially different from the ‘same’ relation that holds between non-voluntary agents. But why should this be, if the wrongness consists in the contradictoriness, rather than in the agents involved in the contradiction? Why should we pick out one instance of contradiction and neglect others? Clarke and Wollaston do not answer this question.
- After Hume has denied that moral judgments are about any matter of fact ‘in the object’, he says what they are really about.³⁶ Though we may suppose we attribute some property to the external situation, we are really talking about our feeling of approval or disapproval.
The objectivist makes the mistake we would make if we thought that irritating people have a special property of irritatingness that they have independently of whether they irritate other people. But in fact, when we say that an action is right or wrong, we really refer both to the non-moral properties of the action, distinct from its rightness or wrongness, and to our sentiment towards the action 
- He therefore attacks not only the cognitivist views of moral properties that take moral knowledge to be demonstrative, but also those that take it to be non-demonstrative knowledge about matters of fact. Since the paragraph on ‘is’ and ‘ought’ (27) is so closely connected with this one (26), it applies to the claim that non-deductive inferences about matters of fact grasped by reason can justify moral conclusions.
Hume might be taken to intend any one of these arguments: (1) The transition from ‘is’ to ‘ought’ not only ‘seems altogether inconceivable’ but is indeed altogether inconceivable; for if we could make this transition, we would show that moral distinctions are matters of fact grasped by reason. (2) What seems inconceivable is not inconceivable. We can make the transition if and only if we supply the right kind of ‘is’, referring to the feeling of the spectator. The fact that we need to supply this kind of ‘is’ shows that the cognitivist position is mistaken.⁴⁸ (3) What seems inconceivable is inconceivable. But what seems inconceivable is not every transition from ‘is’ to ‘ought’, but the transition from ‘is’ judgments about God or human affairs to ‘ought’ judgments. In this instance, the ‘ought’ expresses some new relation or affirmation that is illegitimate, because the relations from which one claims to derive it are entirely different from it. But ‘is’ statements about the feelings of the spectator refer to relations that are not entirely different from those referred to in ‘ought’ statements, and in these cases the transition to ‘ought’ is legitimate.
- It is difficult to decide between these accounts of Hume’s challenge, because he leaves some other aspects of his position quite uncertain. It is especially difficult to decide what he includes in ‘is’ and ‘is not’. He should not include all sentences containing ‘is’ without ‘ought’; for if he included them all, he would count ‘x is good’ and ‘x is right’ as ‘is’ judgments.
But he does not suggest that the transition from ‘It is right for me to do x’ to ‘I ought to do x’ is questionable. Hence, he does not count judgments including ‘is good’ and ‘is right’ as ‘is judgments’.
But how many other judgments are to be ruled out? What about judgments involving (so-called) ‘thick’ moral concepts, such as ‘This is brave’, or ‘This is considerate’ or ‘This is deliberate and unprovoked murder’? One might argue that these are ‘is’ judgments, and that from them some ‘ought’ judgments can be legitimately derived (if they are understood as ‘ought, some things considered’ or ‘ought, unless something more important counts against it’). These judgments raise a question parallel to the question that arose from Hume’s claim that we can know all the properties of an action in itself without knowing whether it is right or wrong. If he disallows the predicates we have mentioned, by objecting that they allow the derivation of an ‘ought’ judgment and so cannot be ‘is’ judgments, he argues in a circle.
But if he does not disallow them on this ground, we seem to have found ‘is’ judgments that give us a legitimate transition to ‘ought’. 
- But let us waive this objection, and assume (contrary to fact) that we can satisfactorily identify the non-evaluative predicates that are allowed to appear in ‘is’ judgments. Hume may intend a further restriction of ‘is’. The only examples of ‘is’ judgments that he gives are about the existence of a God or ‘human affairs’. These are judgments about external objects.
They are also judgments about matters of fact, but they are not the only such judgments.
When we find a ‘sentiment of disapprobation’, this is a matter of fact, but ‘an object of feeling, not of reason’. Hence some matters of fact are not objects of reason. He has also previously allowed this in saying that morality does not consist ‘in any matter of fact, which can be discovered by the understanding’ (26). The ‘which’ clause leaves open the possibility of other matters of fact, and this possibility is actualized in the reference to matters of fact that are objects of feeling.
Here Hume denies that the moral property is a property of, say, the wilful murder itself.
But he does not make it clear whether matters of fact that are objects of feeling can be described in ‘is’ statements. He commits himself more definitely in his summary of the argument about ‘is’ and ‘ought’, when he asserts that the distinction of vice and virtue is not founded merely on the relations of ‘objects’.⁴⁹ If this assertion states the point of the argument about ‘is’ and ‘ought’, we would expect ‘is’ judgments to be judgments about ‘objects’. Now he could hardly deny that it is founded on relations of objects, if ‘objects of feeling’ count as objects; for he has not denied that moral properties are founded on relations of actions to sentiments. Hence he uses ‘objects’ in the more restrictive sense that he used in saying that the vice escapes us as long as we consider the object (26). He means ‘external objects’, in contrast to the ‘objects of feeling’ that we find when we turn our reflexion into our own breast.
- Hume, therefore, seems to identify objective states of affairs with ‘objects of reason’, ‘any matter of fact which can be discovered by the understanding’, and ‘matters of fact whose existence we can infer by reason’. These are a proper subset of matters of fact. He does not explicitly say whether the proper subset or the whole set is described by ‘is’ judgments. But if the argument about ‘is’ and ‘ought’ shows something about inferences from objective states of affairs to moral conclusions, the ‘is’ judgments should be about objective states of affairs.
This is still not quite right, however. We might take objective states of affairs to be contrasted with subjective conditions whose existence depends on the mental state of the subject of the condition. But Hume takes some of these subjective conditions to be among conditions that are ‘in the object’. For judgments about matters of fact ‘in the object’ include judgments about ‘certain passions, motives, volitions and thoughts’ (26). Hence these should also be ‘is’ judgments.
Perhaps, then, Hume takes ‘is’ judgments to include judgments about subjective states of subjects other than the subject making the judgment. When I make judgments about other people’s mental states, the truth of my judgment does not depend on my thoughts and feelings (though it depends on theirs); hence these are judgments about ‘the object’ and are ‘is’ judgments. They are included among the ‘is’ judgments from which people claim to derive ‘ought’ judgments. Hume’s contrast is intelligible, if ‘is’ judgments involve the facts of the situation (including the mental states of the agents involved) apart from the reaction of an observer who makes these judgments. While this narrow use of ‘is’ and this broad use of ‘in the objects’ may confuse us, it is not surprising. Hume takes the scope of ‘is’ judgments to be defined by the claims of the ‘vulgar systems’ that he sets out to refute. 
- If this is Hume’s conception of ‘is’ judgments, what is his answer to his question about deriving ‘ought’ from ‘is’? We might suppose that he thinks the vulgar systems fail to derive ‘ought’ from ‘is’ because they do not set out from the right ‘is’ judgments; they would derive ‘ought’ successfully, on this view, if the ‘is’ judgments included ‘is’ judgments about the reactions of the subject.⁵⁰ This view of Hume’s conclusion, however, conflicts with his restriction of ‘is’ judgments to facts about ‘the object’ in the sense we have explained.
Probably, then, Hume claims that ‘ought’ cannot be derived from ‘is’. Admittedly, he says only that the derivation ‘seems altogether inconceivable’, not that it is inconceivable. But he says it seems altogether inconceivable ‘how this new relation can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it’. He claims that the relation involved in ‘is’ judgments is entirely different from the relation involved in ‘ought’ judgments, not merely that it seems entirely different. If he allowed ‘is’ judgments to include judgments about our reactions, the relations they involve would not be entirely different from those involved in ‘ought’ judgments. Hence he does not treat judgments about our reactions as ‘is’ judgments. He confines ‘is’ judgments to those about objective states of affairs, those that involve ‘relations of objects’. His account of moral judgments does not embody a legitimate transition from ‘is’ to ‘ought’, since it does not involve a derivation of the ‘ought’ relation from others that are entirely different from it. The ‘ought’ judgment is not derived from ‘is’ judgments alone, but from ‘is’ judgments plus judgments about our reactions.
But what is the ‘ought’ judgment? In declaring that moral properties are objects of feeling rather than reason, Hume compares them with the Lockean view (as Hutcheson understands it)⁵¹ that secondary qualities ‘are not qualities in objects but perceptions in the mind’ (iii 1.1.26). If this parallel is exact, moral properties are also perceptions in the mind. In that case, they are not feelings and reactions, but judgments about them, just as the judgment that something is red is not itself the sensation of red. Since Hume takes a belief to be simply ‘a lively idea, related to or associated with a present impression’ (i 3.7.5), a moral judgment should be the lively idea associated with the sentiment of approval or disapproval.
If this view is right, Hume takes his discussion of ‘is’ and ‘ought’ to show that moral judgments are beliefs with a particular subject-matter, and that they are expressed by statements; they report and describe the spectator’s reaction to actions and people.
- A non-cognitivist interpretation gains only superficial support from Hume’s use of ‘is’ and ‘ought’. We have seen that his use of ‘is’ in the relevant contexts narrows the range of ‘is’ judgments to only a subset of statements containing ‘is’. When I describe my own feelings, I make a statement, but I do not make one of Hume’s ‘is’ judgments. The fact that he contrasts ‘ought’ with ‘is’ does not show that he means to distinguish the imperative from the indicative. 
- A better argument for a non-cognitivist interpretation rests on Hume’s practical argument.
This argument succeeds only if moral judgments by themselves are practical. But Hume’s argument about reason and passion implies that the only mental items that are practical by themselves are passions. Hence moral judgments must be passions. If judgments about passions are distinguishable from passions, they do not motivate us in their own right. Even if they are simply lively ideas accompanying present impressions, and therefore inseparable from the passions they accompany, they depend on the passions for motivation. The practical argument, therefore, favours a non-cognitivist interpretation.
If this is true, the practical and the metaphysical argument seem to favour different conclusions. The passage on ‘is’ and ‘ought’ sums up the metaphysical argument. It concludes that moral judgments are beliefs about one’s sentiments, not about objective facts. The practical argument suggests that moral judgments are really not beliefs at all, but sentiments. The difference between these accounts of moral judgments may not be clear to Hume. He argues that ‘the vice entirely escapes you, as long as you consider the object’ (iii 1.1.26); this is true whichever way he treats moral judgments. But it is not clear whether we make the moral judgment in describing and reporting our sentiment or in feeling it. 
- It is reasonable, then, for non-cognitivists to claim that Hume has anticipated them, and their claims should not be dismissed as anachronistic.⁵³ They ought not to claim that Hume is a non-cognitivist, since some of his arguments seem to support a subjectivist descriptive view of moral judgments. But they are right to claim that he offers arguments that support a non-cognitivist conclusion. The argument about ‘is’ and ‘ought’ supports non-cognitivism no better than it supports subjectivism, but the practical argument supports non-cognitivism. 
- The difference between subjectivism and non-cognitivism is probably not obvious to Hume, partly because it is not always clear whether he is discussing moral properties or moral virtues or moral judgments. He sets out from the general claim that ‘morals’ influence action, and his doctrine seeks to embody this claim by showing that ‘morals’ essentially include sentiments, so that we miss moral goodness and badness until we attend to our sentiments. But this might be true either because:
    * ‘morals’ are moral judgments, which are essentially sentiments (non-cognitivism). The practical argument favours a non-cognitivist view. 
    * ‘morals’ are moral properties, which are sentiments, whereas moral judgments are first-person beliefs about these sentiments (subjectivism). Hume’s metaphysical argument and his discussion of ‘is’ and ‘ought’ favour a subjectivist view
- After rejecting cognitivist and objectivist views, Hume maintains that moral distinctions are not derived from reason, but from a moral sense. We must turn our reflexion into our own breast (iii 1.1.26), to our sentiments of approval and disapproval. This reference to our approval and disapproval introduces a moral sense.
ThisconclusionrestsindifferentwaysonHume’spracticalandhismetaphysicalargument.
Only the practical argument shows that the moral sense itself makes the moral judgment, because there is nothing to the moral judgment beyond the feeling of approval that belongs to the moral sense. This is Hume’s position, if he sees the connexion between internalism and non-cognitivism. He relies on his view that ‘morals’ influence passions and actions.
In saying this he might intend either of two claims: (1) The existence of moral goodness involves someone’s having a motive to act on it. (2) The judgment that an action is morally good involves being motivated to do it.
The first view makes goodness something like sound, on the assumption that there are no unheard sounds. It would not be possible, on this view, for an action to be morally good if no one felt approval for it, since this feeling of approval is necessary (according to Hume) for motivation. The second view does not make this claim about moral properties directly, but appeals to the connexion between moral judgments and motivation.
The metaphysical argument also introduces the moral sense. It argues that moral properties do not consist in matters of fact ‘in the object’, independent of the reactions of the spectator; hence objectivism is false. Moral properties consist at least in part in the feelings of a spectator, and these feelings, in Hume’s view, belong to a moral sense. It does not follow, however, from this argument that moral judgments are the reactions of a moral sense. Our grasp of moral properties might be purely cognitive, not involving any feeling of approval;
it might be a report of the reactions of observers, either ourselves or other people. If I am both the judge and the observer, my moral judgment reports my feeling of approval, but the judgment may be distinct from the feeling of approval. 
- We have also noticed a version of the metaphysical argument that relies on the practical argument: (1) If a moral judgment were wholly about a (purported) a matter of fact in the object, it would be logically possible for us to recognize that matter of fact without being motivated by it. (2) If this were logically possible, moral judgments would not involve motivation. (3) Hence moral judgments cannot be wholly about any property of the object itself. If this is Hume’s argument, he assumes that the motivating character of moral judgments is a logically necessary truth derived from the content of the judgments themselves. He cannot agree that it is a contingent truth about the making of the judgments in normal circumstances. This is the version of the metaphysical argument that Hume offers in ‘The Sceptic’.¹ 
- Whichever of these accounts of Hume’s arguments is correct, his conclusion rejects objectivism; he denies that moral goodness and badness, rightness and wrongness, consist in any properties that things have independently of the reactions of an observer. A moral property exists only if the observer has the appropriately favourable or unfavourable sentiment in response to it.³ This is what Hume means in claiming that we cannot find the virtue or vice until we find the relevant sentiment within our own breasts.
Though he rejects objectivism, he does not deny that moral judgments are about objective features of things. If I judge that this benevolent action is right, or that this murder is wrong, I rely on a judgment that this action is benevolent or that action is an unprovoked killing of an innocent victim. But though I make the judgment about the moral property on the basis of these judgments about objective properties of the action and the people involved, my judgment about the moral property does not regard it as an objective property.⁴ The moral property exists only if the observer has the relevant sort of response. 
- Hume does not mean that goodness or badness consists simply in the feeling of the observer. If he did mean this, his view would have absurd results; one might argue that if this is where the badness of murder is found, I acquire the badness of murder, and so become bad, simply by having a feeling of disapproval.⁵ Hume means that the badness of the murder consists in the deliberate killing of an innocent victim and the resulting disapproval by the observer; he does not mean that the badness would exist if the feeling of disapproval existed but no murder had been committed. 
- If Hume reaches an anti-objectivist conclusion, what is his conclusion about? Is it about the meaning of moral judgments, and hence about the metaphysical claims that they imply? Or is it about the nature of moral facts themselves? His claim that in making a moral judgment about an action we ‘mean’ only that we have a sentiment about it does not answer all our questions.⁶ For we might take the claim in at least three ways: 
    * Moral judgments are statements about the speaker’s feelings - The first view faces a simple objection. If you judge an action to be right, and I judge the same action to be wrong, but I mean that I disapprove of the action and you mean that you approve of it, my judgment that the action is wrong does not contradict your judgment that it is right. But in fact we think the two judgments are contradictory. This is a good reason for supposing that Hume has not given the right account of the meaning of a moral judgment.
Our view about when moral judgments contradict each other seems to presuppose that we take them to be judgments about ‘the objects themselves’, and not about our reactions. 
    * Moral judgments are not statements about feelings, but expressions of feelings. The second view of what we ‘mean’ in speaking of moral rightness makes moral judgments into expressions of sentiments, rather than statements about them. This is the non-cognitivist interpretation of Hume’s position. 
    * When we make moral judgments, we are only talking about (referring to) feelings.
 








#                   Difficulties

- But Martineau and Hume over-estimate the degree to which Hutcheson agrees with Butler. Though he goes some way towards acceptance of Butler’s view of conscience, he stops short on one crucial point. In Butler’s view, superior principles essentially appeal to authority rather than mere strength. If conscience is supreme, it is also most authoritative.
If it has authority to decide the questions it decides, it appeals to considerations that take legitimate precedence over the considerations that lower principles appeal to. One might infer that a supreme principle, so understood, must be a rational principle. But Hutcheson rejects that inference. He does not treat the moral sense as rational.
- we might well suppose that epistemological and metaphysical arguments spread sceptical doubt to experimental science. For experimental science deals with causal relations, relies on induction, and examines relations between external objects and human minds. Why should we not doubt its possibility if we accept Hume’s sceptical doubts about causation and so on? We might answer that experimental science does not concern itself with the causal connexions that are open to sceptical doubt. Even if this answer preserved experimental science from doubts about causation, it would be difficult to defend an analogous answer about induction and the external world. But in any case Hume does not offer this answer even about causation; for he agrees that the search for objective causal connexions is inseparable from empirical inquiry.¹⁰ He cannot, then, claim that his sceptical doubts do not apply to experimental science.
To reconcile experimental science with scepticism, he claims that we can concede the cogency of the sceptical argument without doing anything about it. Even if we admit that, strictly speaking, the science of human nature is based on illusions and errors, we do not worry about this sceptical conclusion when we are engaged in our experimental science. But if this is Hume’s view, the post-sceptical experimental science is not exactly the same as the pre-sceptical science that we relied on to support sceptical doubts. For in our pre-sceptical phase we do not admit that, strictly speaking, our experimental science is based on illusions, whereas we admit just this about our post-sceptical experimental science. The pre-sceptical science claims to reach justified conclusions about the real world, whereas the post-sceptical science makes no such claims.
Perhaps Hume might reject these claims about pre-sceptical and post-sceptical exper-imental science. He might say that the experimental science is just the same whether or not we are sceptics; our pre-sceptical and post-sceptical phases affect our epistemo-logical attitude to experimental science, not the outlook of experimental science itself.
But it is difficult to defend this division between the science and our epistemological attitude to it. Our experience, as we understand it, of boiling kettles and bare hands placed on them convinces us of claims, based on experience, about the causal rela-tions between boiling kettles and burnt hands. We cannot separate conviction on the basis of experience, taken to be of objects and causal relations, from common-sense beliefs or experimental science. A post-sceptical science needs to replace these beliefs with an outlook that persists after sceptical scrutiny; this outlook does not include conviction on the basis of evidence taken to support the conviction. The scope of Hume’s scepticism prevents him from separating experimental science from sceptical attitudes. 
- If common-sense views about morality commit us to claims about objectivity that Hume refutes, we have no reason to believe that anything is right or wrong. What difference might this make? Hume believes that the sceptical argument about secondary qualities makes no practical difference.¹¹ But his account of the impact of scepticism does not fit this judgment. 
- Hume does not believe that scepticism undermines ordinary moral convictions; for he believes, contrary to Balguy, that ordinary convictions do not include the beliefs that are undermined by his sceptical arguments against other philosophers. Changes in beliefs about the status of moral beliefs do not, in Hume’s view, affect moral beliefs or their practical significance. But if he is wrong on this point, his sceptical arguments may damage morality more than he recognizes. Such damage would be unwelcome to Hume, since he takes himself to be explaining and supporting moral convictions by revealing their true principles. 
- In a letter that describes his early philosophical development, Hume criticizes the ancient moralists for inattention to human nature. He claims that their views on virtue and happiness rest on groundless assumptions and prejudices, rather than on acquaintance with the relevant experimental details. He proposes, therefore, to pursue the study of human nature with the aim of deriving the whole of moral philosophy from it.¹³ What specific cases might support Hume’s claim that the ancients do not attend to human nature? Perhaps he means that, for instance, the Stoics would not have identified virtue with happiness if they had known more about human psychology.¹⁴ Because of their claims about virtue and happiness, they demand a humanly impossible degree of detachment from external goods. Even if some detachment is possible, perhaps it does more harm than good, by weakening morally desirable impulses as well.¹⁵ But even if this is a defensible criticism of the Stoics, it does not support Hume’s general verdict on the ancients. For some ancient critics attack the Stoics for their inattention to human nature.¹⁶ Hence these critics agree with Hume on the relevance of human nature. Moreover, the Stoics themselves have quite a lot to say about human nature, the passions, and human action. They do not agree with Hume on these topics, but they attend to facts about human nature. Chrysippus, Seneca, and Epictetus study our natural reactions to recognized goods and evils, in order to argue that we need different reactions that bring us closer to living a life that accords with nature. Both the Stoics and their critics attend to human nature, though they have different accounts of what nature requires. Hume might answer that simply talking of what one conceives as ‘human nature’ is not the attention to human nature that he recommends. Some Greek claims about human nature are not purely predictive, non-normative claims about human constitution or behaviour, but include a normative component. Butler recognizes this feature of ancient conceptions of nature in his own third sense of ‘nature’, which refers to the requirements of a system as a whole. As Butler says, this third sense tells us what the Stoics have in mind in claiming that virtue consists in living in accord with nature.
Hume’s division between the ‘experimental’ and the ‘hypothetical’ outlook applies to the normative conceptions of nature that we find in ancient moral philosophy in mind; his attack on the ancients applies no less to Butler.¹⁷ If this is at least part of what Hume means in claiming that ancient moral philosophy is ‘hypothetical’, he is right about the difference between himself and the ancients.
- Some of the ancients are right, in Hume’s view, about the nature and extent of the virtues.²⁰ He is a ‘great admirer’ of Cicero; he relies on Cicero’s catalogue of virtues, even though he believes that the Stoic moral theory from which Cicero derives his catalogue is hopelessly hypothetical. Perhaps he believes that Cicero’s catalogue does not really depend on Stoic moral theory. But if Cicero has a correct catalogue of the virtues, and if such a catalogue depends on accurate experimental science of human nature, how can ancient moralists fail to regard human nature? 
- Hume’s reasons for taking the ancients to be implicit anti-rationalists are as unconvincing as Hutcheson’s reasons for taking them to be explicit anti-rationalists. One might identify virtue with control by reason while still recognizing the importance of training one’s sentiments and emotions. If Hume had known the ethical works of Aristotle and Aquinas, he would have found that they give an important place to the emotions, and that Aquinas discusses the emotions in some detail. Such attention to the emotions does not conflict with the view that the moral virtues require subordination of the emotions to will and practical reason.
- Hume gives two reasons for rejecting the division between moral virtues and other good qualities: (1) Self-regarding as well as other-regarding traits, and excellences of intellect as well as of affection, are often counted as virtues. (2) The distinction between voluntary and involuntary does not separate real moral virtues from other qualities.²⁵ He cites the ancient moralists in support of his first claim.²⁶ He also takes them to be indifferent to the voluntary character of virtues.²⁷ He holds that Christian moralists deny both of his claims, and refers to The Whole Duty of Man.²⁸
- In his view, we would agree with him about the range of the virtues if we practised the experimental method. But Christian philosophers have not practised it, because theologicalpresuppositionshaveturnedtheirattentiontoquestionsaboutpraiseandblame.³⁷ Christian influence has made the issue about voluntariness seem important, and has warped the scope and character of moral philosophy so as to make this issue unduly prominent. 
- Hume follows Hutcheson in absorbing some of Butler’s views within a sentimentalist position. But he rejects other aspects of Butler’s position. In particular, he denies that virtue is natural to human beings.⁴⁷ He opposes the natural to the miraculous, to the unusual, and to the artificial, and argues that in none of these senses of ‘natural’ is virtue natural and vice unnatural.⁴⁸ Since these senses of ‘natural’ include all those that are relevant to naturalism about virtue, Butler’s system is unphilosophical.
None of Hume’s senses of ‘natural’, however, fits Butler. For Butler’s crucial third sense of ‘natural’ fits none of Hume’s senses. This is the sense that is relevant to Butler’s claim that what is natural for a natural organism is what is required by its whole constitution and system, as opposed to each particular part.⁴⁹ Butler does not mean simply that virtue is non-miraculous, usual, or non-artificial; hence the fact that these features do not distinguish virtue from vice does not affect Butler’s thesis.
Elsewhere Hume notices a sense of ‘natural’ that is more relevant to Butler. He suggests that Hutcheson appeals to nature in a sense that involves some teleological assumptions.
This is a reasonable interpretation of Butler’s claims too. But Hume adds, without further argument, the more questionable claim that the relevant teleological claims can be defended only by an appeal to design.⁵⁰ For reasons that he gives in his Dialogues, he believes that no sufficient empirical case can be made for the claim that natural organisms are designed for some end.⁵¹ To show that Hutcheson’s implicit claim about ends involves him in theology, Hume alludes to the first question in the Shorter Catechism (‘What is the chief end of man?’) and to the answer (‘. . . to glorify God and enjoy him for ever’).⁵² Hutcheson tries to avoid any appeal to such dogmatic claims by basing morality on nature; but Hume’s questions suggest that this attempt fails, because the teleological aspects of nature raise questions that cannot be settled by natural reason.
A teleological sense of ‘natural’ fits Butler’s claim that some things are natural for an organism because they are appropriate for the organism as a whole. But it is a further step to claim that they are appropriate because they promote the activities for which the organism was designed. Perhaps, then, Hume’s main objection to Butler claims that Butler’s normative conception of the natural relies on an ‘unphilosophical’ assumption about design. Hume is right to believe that both Butler and Hutcheson regard human beings as products of design. It does not follow, however, that a belief in design is needed to support the normative claim that an organism’s nature and constitution require one course of action rather than another. Irrespective of beliefs about design, facts about a system and constitution as a whole seem to support claims about what is natural for an organism. We rely on such claims when we say that someone needs to have a tooth extracted or needs an operation.⁵⁴ To see how far Hume departs from Butler’s naturalistic form of argument, we should consider his views on these claims about needs. 
- The Inquiry is more conciliatory than the Treatise about naturalism. Hume allows that justice is natural, since it tends to arise from the operation of natural human tendencies.⁵⁵ If we seek to contrast the natural with the artificial, we must conclude that justice is artificial rather than natural. Still, disputes about naturalness are merely verbal, since justice is also natural in a clear and acceptable sense.
These conciliatory remarks about nature do not mark a difference of substance from the Treatise. For, though they allow us to claim that virtues are natural, they do not show that they are distinctively natural; vices might equally be natural in the sense that Hume allows.
Hume goes further towards Butler’s position, however, in some of his claims about the moral sense. In the Treatise his attack on naturalism about virtue immediately follows his argument to show that the sentiments of morality are natural. According to his account of the senses of ‘natural’, he need only show that these sentiments are frequently found in human beings. But he says more than this. Though he does not affirm that virtue consists in acting in accordance with nature, he accepts part of the relevant conception of nature. In his view, human beings who have their moral sentiments extirpated and destroyed fall into disease or madness.⁵⁶ Here Hume implicitly acknowledges one clear sense, apart from those he explicitly recognizes, in which an action or condition may be natural or against nature. To say that the removal of some trait is liable to cause disease or madness is not simply to say that the trait is frequent; for many frequent traits might be removed without these effects. In speaking of disease or madness, Hume recognizes that some things are required by, or appropriate for, a human being as a whole system. Disease and madness are not simply infrequent conditions; they oppose the needs of the whole system. What the whole system needs is what Butler calls ‘natural’ in his third sense. Hume, therefore, allows that some things are natural, in Butler’s third sense. He even regards the moral sentiments as natural, in this sense.
Hume might reject this argument because it assumes that disease and madness must be understood by reference to the needs of a whole system. If he could replace this holistic and evaluative (because of ‘needs’) claim with an ‘experimental’ and purely statistical claim, he would show that truths about health and sanity do not concede the substance of Butler’s claims about appropriateness to nature. He might claim for instance that madness and disease are conditions that interfere with aims that most people share, irrespective of their upbringing and environment, and that this is what makes them natural. If he defends this claim, he accepts a version of naturalism, though it is not Butler’s version.
- Hume, in contrast to Hutcheson, does not treat Butler’s view as an alternative to the extreme rationalism of Clarke. He rejects Hutcheson’s attempted reconciliation of Butler with sentimentalism.⁶⁸ Here he is partly right and partly wrong. Hume is right to suggest that Butler’s position does not fit sentimentalism. But Hutcheson is right to suggest that Butler’s position is different from Clarke’s. Hume ignores or overlooks this difference; probably he classifies Butler with Clarke as a theorist about the ‘abstract nature of things’. This judgment is based on Butler’s non-experimental and normative conception of nature. 
- If Hume is right about the role of calm passions, prudent choices for the future depend on ignorance of future circumstances. If I made all these circumstances clear to myself, I might excite violent passions that would overcome the calm passion that underlies my prudent reasoning. His attempt to explain how we can see overriding reason to choose the prudent course of action removes the aspect of prudent action that makes it genuinely prudent. To explain and to undermine our belief that we consider the weight of reasons rather than the strength of desires, Hume concentrates on these cases where I do not know in advance what the prudent choice will cost me in the future. He fails to explain these cases. 
- But if he simply asserts that his account is exhaustive, and does not identify some further error in the claims about practical reason that he rejects, his argument should not move opponents who attribute some further function to reason. Since he does not adequately defend his account of the functions of reason, he is unwise to rely on it to support his account of justifying reasons. He would have a good case if he had shown that the justifying reasons we offer are good reasons only if we presuppose the relevant calm passions. But he has not shown this. Though some justifying reasons presuppose antecedent desires in the agent for whom they are good reasons, not all justifying reasons are of this kind.

- Hume introduces calm passions here because they are needed to show that exciting reasons always involve a passion, not because he has any other good reason for introducing them.⁴³
- Hume’s two treatments overlook the view maintained by Aquinas, and to some extent by Cudworth and Locke, that freewill consists in determination by the will, as opposed to the passions.⁴⁹ Determination by will is freedom (according to Aquinas) because the will is not determined to one course of action apart from rational reflexion, but is moved by the rational reflexion that chooses among different possible actions. Hume follows Hobbes and Hutcheson in ignoring this alleged difference between will and passion. In listing the different sources of the false belief in freedom, he does not mention Locke’s candidate—the capacity to suspend the operation of passions on the basis of rational consideration. 
- Hisargumentsonreasonandpassionseemtosupport ascepticalpositiononresponsibility.
His appeals to temporary and permanent features of agents do not support our views on responsibility, because our views rest on a conception of practical reason and the will that Hume rejects. If we agree with Hume’s view of practical reason and responsibility, our sentiments of praise and blame may not disappear; they may be stubborn, even if their rational basis is undermined. But we might doubt whether they will or should matter as much to us, if we decide that they rest on false or unjustified presuppositions about will and reason.
Here, then, we might be tempted to draw more sceptical conclusions than Hume draws.⁵⁰ His account of practical reason and prudence does not support ordinary claims about prudence, but conflicts with them. Similarly, his views about practical reason cast doubt on our conception of free and responsible agency. Contrary to Hume’s intentions, his sceptical attitude to ordinary beliefs about objectivity and personal identity seems to provide a pattern for the attitude that we will take to moral beliefs if we grasp the significance of his arguments. 
- He now defends anti-rationalism not only about practical reason and motivation, but also about morality. His discussion of reason and passion implicitly attacks Butler’s views on superior principles and self-love; he now attacks Butler’s views on conscience. Butler regards conscience as the expression of reason, as a source of moral requirements, and as a superior principle carrying authority. Hume rejects these claims.
Hume offers two distinct arguments to show that moral distinctions are not derived from reason. The first is his ‘practical argument’:¹ (1) Reason alone cannot move us to action.
(2) But moral distinctions move us to action. (3) Hence moral distinctions cannot be derived from reason. The first step is derived from Hume’s argument about the roles of reason and passion (in ii 3.3). Since Hume’s defence of his first step is open to doubt, the doubt spreads to the practical argument. 
- Hume’s second argument against rationalism is his ‘metaphysical argument’:² (1) Reason discovers only relations of ideas or matters of fact. (2) Moral truths correspond neither to relations of ideas nor to matters of fact. (3) Hence moral truths are not discovered by reason.
Again we may concede the first step to Hume for the sake of argument. In the second step he seeks to show that the moral goodness or badness of an action cannot consist in any fact about the action itself apart from the feelings of the person judging the action good or bad.
- Against a purely cognitive view of moral properties, Hume appeals to the practical aspect of morality.⁴ We believe that ‘morals have an influence on the actions and affections’ (iii 1.1.6). To see what this belief commits us to, we need to see what Hume means by ‘morals’, ‘morality’, and ‘moral distinctions’. He might have in mind (1) the properties of rightness or wrongness themselves, or (2) the moral condition—virtue or vice—of a person who acts rightly or wrongly (‘a person of good morals’). A purely cognitive view of ‘morals’ in the first sense does not imply a purely cognitive view of ‘morals’ in the second sense.
Even if moral properties are objects of rational cognition, virtue or vice need not be purely cognitive. The view that virtue is conformity to reason is not a purely cognitive view of virtue; for if a virtuous person’s will must conform to reason, such conformity to reason is not a purely cognitive condition. If Hume simply appeals to the practical effects of ‘morals’, understoodasvirtueandvice, hedoesnot refuteapurely cognitiveviewofmoral properties.⁵
- Hume’s argument against cognitivism, therefore, relies on one of two sorts of connexions between ‘morals’ and motivation:⁷ (1) If he means that duty governs me, he asserts a connexion between the existence of moral properties and motivation. He needs this connexion if his claim about motivation is to defeat an objectivist conception of moral properties. (2) If he means that my awareness of duty governs me, he asserts a connexion between my recognizing the truth of a moral judgment and my being motivated to act on it. According to this view, it is essential to a moral judgment—not to the existence of the property mentioned in the judgment—that it moves the agent to act on it. 
- If we can explain why we are normally concerned about moral questions, we can explain why moral judgments govern our action, even if they are as cognitive as judgments about the weather. To refute a purely cognitive view, Hume needs to argue that moral judgments are different from judgments about the weather because they motivate us by themselves. Is this a matter of common experience?
The task of answering this question is complicated by Hume’s discussion of reason and passion. A cognitivist might agree with Hume’s view that moral judgments by themselves can motivate us. This cognitivist believes: (1) Moral judgments by themselves motivate us. 2) Moral judgments are purely cognitive. (3) Therefore purely cognitive states sometimes motivate us. But Hume rejects this cognitivist position, because he believes: (4) Cognitive states can contribute to action only when they are suitably connected to passions that are independent of them. Hence Hume infers: (5) Moral judgments motivate us all by themselves because they imply passions and are not purely cognitive.
Hume’s position, then, depends on our being persuaded to accept (4) while still accepting (1), so that we reject (2). But might we not take (4) to be a reason for denying (1) while accept-ing (2)? Hume agrees that we have the experience of moral judgments moving us to action all by themselves, without any further desire. But he disagrees with rationalists who interpret this experience as the experience of purely cognitive states moving us to action without any non-cognitive state. Hume rejects the rationalist interpretation because he thinks we must always be moved by a passion. When we seem to be moved by moral judgments without any passion, he believes we are really moved by a calm passion distinct from any reasoning.But if we agree with Hume here, why should we not abandon our original view that we experience moral judgments by themselves moving us to action? Even if action requires passion, how can experience tell us that the relevant passion is part of the moral judgment?
Introspection does not seem to be decisive; for if the appearance of a purely cognitive state moving us to action is misleading, might the appearance of a moral judgment by itself moving us to action not be equally misleading? Hume’s claims about calm passions cast doubt on introspection; for calm passions tend to escape introspection, but we need to assume them to explain action that (to a rationalist) appears to be explained by reason alone.
Hume’s view on reason and passions seems to undermine his argument against a cognitivist account of moral judgments. If we agree with his account of reason and passion, we have no reason to trust introspection as much as we need to trust it if we are to agree that moral judgments by themselves move us to action.
Common experience, therefore, does not seem to show that moral judgments alone motivate us. But if it does not show this, it allows a purely cognitive view of moral judgments. Hume uses his conclusion about reason and passion as a premiss of his practical argument. But his arguments about reason and passion suggest that experience does not support the practical argument.
- Against internalism we may argue that the apparent impossibility of moral judgments without motivation simply reflects the regular presence of the relevant calm passions together with our moral judgments. Hume’s earlier argument helps an opponent of his argument about moral judgments and motivation. 
- According to Hume, judgments affect passions by informing them about the existence or the properties of the relevant object; if we make a false judgment about the existence of a glass of milk, or if we want a healthy drink and falsely believe that this glass of milk is healthy, our action of trying to get a glass of milk is (in the ‘abusive’ sense) unreasonable.
But the cognitivist gains nothing by appealing to this sort of unreasonableness, since it is irrelevant to the moral properties of the action or the agent.¹⁷ For if the cognitivist were right, errors of moral judgment would have to be these purely factual errors; but purely factual errors are not blameworthy, whereas errors of moral judgment are blameworthy;
hence the cognitivist is wrong.
Cognitivists might try two answers to Hume: (1) They might deny his claim that no purely factual errors are blameworthy, even if they agree that he has given a full list of factual errors. His appeal to common sense shows that many factual errors are regarded as innocent; but it does not show that all factual errors, on whatever subject and in whatever circumstances, are blameless. If, for instance, it is easy and important for us to find out some fact, and we do not find it out, we may be blameworthy for not finding it out. (2) They might reject Hume’s claim about what reason can find out, and in particular they might deny that reason can only find out about existence and about instrumental means to ends.
Aristotle and Aquinas take moral error to be a form of deliberative error about what sorts of actions and states of character promote one’s good. For the reasons we have considered, this is not purely instrumental deliberation; but error in such deliberation is error about some fact. Perhaps the Aristotelian view faces difficulties in explaining how this sort of error can be blameworthy; but it need not agree with Hume that an error about a fact is free from blame.
Since these answers are available to a cognitivist, Hume’s argument about responsibility does not refute cognitivism. 
- One of his objections attacks the anti-voluntarist view that moral right and wrong are not constituted by anyone’s will, and that they equally oblige all rational agents, including God.
He believes that the rationalist cannot defend this universal obligation; even if all rational agents knew the relevant principles, it might not motivate all of them, because knowing virtue does not imply conforming the will to it.²⁰ This objection is surprising. If Hume allows the possibility of knowing virtue without motivation, he seems to contradict the internalist claims that underlie the practical argument.
Perhaps, then, he means ‘conforming the will’ in a more demanding sense that does not simply imply some motivation, but requires overriding motivation. The objection, so understood, would be consistent with internalism. But it does not seem to damage Hume’s opponents. Rationalists have no reason to agree with Hume that universal obligation implies universal motivation, since (as we have seen) they need not accept his internalism about exciting reasons.
If the question about obligation is confined to justifying reasons, it may be an awkward question for Clarke. Why should we be concerned with the abstract relations of consistency and contradiction that Clarke identifies with moral right and wrong? This objection, however, does not apply to Butler, who tries to show how acting on reason is acting in accord with nature. 
- Hume’s second objection concerns the sort of relation that a rationalist must identify with moral rightness and wrongness.²¹ He argues that the moral badness of ingratitude cannot consist in a relation between the agents, but must consist in a spectator’s reaction to them. We should reject an objectivist answer, because the relation between the ungrateful person and the victim of ingratitude can be found in other situations that involve nothing morally wrong. The choking of a tree by one of its saplings displays the same objective relations as the murder of a parent by a child; since the latter action is wrong and the former is not, its wrongness cannot consist in an objective fact, but must consist in our reaction to it.
- Perhaps Hume has in mind a further argument to show that a complete description does not include moral badness. He may argue: (1) If the moral badness of murder is a property of the murder itself, it must be identical to some objective property F-ness (where ‘F’ is some predicate other than ‘moral goodness’). (2) But whatever we choose as F-ness, it is conceivable that two observers agree that murder is F, but disagree about whether it is morally bad. (3) If such disagreement is conceivable, Fness is not identical to its moral badness. (4) Hence no objective property of murder is identical to its moral badness.
This argument begs a question against Price, who does not accept the first premiss. Price agrees with this premiss only if ‘complex property’ or ‘definable property’ is substituted in the antecedent for ‘property’. With this substitution, Price uses the argument to show that moral properties are simple and indefinable. Hume gives no reason for accepting his first premiss, and so he gives no reason for preferring his account of moral properties over Price’s.²⁷ For similar reasons, Hume’s argument might be adapted to support Moore’s view that goodness is a simple non-natural property. According to Moore, Hume’s first premiss is a mistake that Moore connects with the Naturalistic Fallacy.²⁸ If we waive this objection to Hume’s first step, and grant that if moral properties are objective, they are also complex and definable, we might still question Hume’s third step.
Perhaps A and B disagree because B supposes something self-contradictory. In that case, what A believes may still be true, and indeed necessarily true, even if B disagrees with it.
Perhaps, then, Hume means to avoid this objection, by claiming that if ‘F-ness is badness’ can be denied without evident contradiction, F-ness is not identical to badness.
This reply is hardly convincing. Even if it does not appear self-contradictory to suppose that deliberately killing an innocent person is not bad, the deliberate killing may still be the moral badness in the action. We may grant that if two properties are really identical, their identity is necessary, but we need not agree that the necessity is logical necessity.²⁹
- But let us concede that if F-ness is badness, ‘F-ness is not bad’ is self-contradictory. Hume still faces difficulties that raise a wider question about his strategy. He seems to assume that if something appears to be conceivable (murder’s not being wrong, for instance), it is conceivable, and is therefore possible.³⁰ On this point he agrees with Moore’s Open Question Argument. Moore maintains that if it does not immediately appear self-contradictory to say that x is F but x is not good, goodness is not F-ness. Both Hume and Moore make it too easy to reject proposed definitions.³¹ Hume’s use of this argument is especially surprising in the light of his practical argument.
For internalism implies that it is inconceivable, and therefore logically impossible, to judge that doing x is morally right without being moved to do x. If we understood that moral judgments include motivation, we would also understand that what we took to be conceivable (that someone could judge that X is bad, but do X after that - Tim. B.) is in fact impossible, and therefore inconceivable. If this is a reasonable defence of Hume’s practical argument against a claim about conceivability, it suggests an objectivist answer to Hume’s metaphysical argument. If we think it is conceivable for something to meet all the conditions for deliberate murder without being bad, we simply show our ignorance of badness.
Hume, therefore, assumes in his metaphysical argument a test for possibility that undermines his practical argument. In the practical argument he assumes that we must test and (if necessary) correct intuitions about conceivability in the light of prior judgments about possibility. In the metaphysical argument, however, he assumes that we must form judgments about possibility in the light of prior intuitions about conceivability. Since his assumptions about conceivability and possibility in each case are implicit, he does not see that they conflict. But since they conflict, his practical argument and his metaphysical argument cannot both be sound.
Hume would avoid this dilemma if his practical argument did not rely on the logical impossibility of separating moral judgments from motivation. If he could show that it is simply a well-confirmed empirical generalization that moral judgments motivate by themselves, his practical argument would not rest on a claim about conceivability and possibility that conflicts with the claim underlying his metaphysical argument. We saw, however, that empirical arguments face objections arising from Hume’s doctrine of calm passions (When we seem to be moved by moral judgments without any passion, he believes we are really moved by a calm passion distinct from any reasoning.
But if we agree with Hume here, why should we not abandon our original view that we experience moral judgments by themselves moving us to action? Even if action requires passion, how can experience tell us that the relevant passion is part of the moral judgment?
Introspection does not seem to be decisive; for if the appearance of a purely cognitive state moving us to action is misleading, might the appearance of a moral judgment by itself moving us to action not be equally misleading? Hume’s claims about calm passions cast doubt on introspection; for calm passions tend to escape introspection, but we need to assume them to explain action that (to a rationalist) appears to be explained by reason alone.
Hume’s view on reason and passions seems to undermine his argument against a cognitivist account of moral judgments. If we agree with his account of reason and passion, we have no reason to trust introspection as much as we need to trust it if we are to agree that moral judgments by themselves move us to action.
Common experience, therefore, does not seem to show that moral judgments alone motivate us. But if it does not show this, it allows a purely cognitive view of moral judgments. Hume uses his conclusion about reason and passion as a premiss of his practical argument. But his arguments about reason and passion suggest that experience does not support the practical argument). 
He seems to have no easy alternative to an argument from logical impossibility;
and therefore he seems to face the dilemma we have described.
- Hume might try a different objection against the claim that the badness of the murder is a property of the murder itself. He might point out that we could recognize all the properties of the murder itself and still be quite unmoved by them. This argument assumes that the badness of an action must be something that motivates the person making the judgment of badness to condemn the action or to avoid doing it. a complete grasp of the properties of a murder may not result in the sentiment characteristic of morality.
Hume’s argument about the poem seems to assume that we cannot be aware of beauty without feeling the right sentiment.³⁴ Similarly, he assumes, we cannot recognize the moral properties of an action without being motivated to act. Since we can recognize all the properties of the object itself without being motivated, moral properties are not properties of the object itself. This argument might be understood in other ways: (1) The claim that beauty is not an objective property of the poem is a premiss from which we infer that the mathematician knows everything in the poem even without knowing its beauty. (2) The premiss says that he knows everything in the poem, and the conclusion says that beauty is not in the poem.
(1) makes theargumentuseless for provingthatbeautyis notin thepoem. (2) requires us to agree, withoutbeinggiven any reason, that the mathematician knows all the properties in the poem. Neither interpretation provides a good argument
- Hume’s argument about the poem seems to assume that we cannot be aware of beauty without feeling the right sentiment.³⁴ Similarly, he assumes, we cannot recognize the moral properties of an action without being motivated to act. Since we can recognize all the properties of the object itself without being motivated, moral properties are not properties of the object itself.
This interpretation gives Hume the best argument. It offers to explain and to justify the assumption underlying the metaphysical argument. That argument assumes that moral properties are not among the properties of the object itself, and this assumption is justified because moral properties are essentially connected with motivation, but facts about the object itself could not be essentially connected with motivation. If this is what Hume means, he believes that the practical character of moral judgments gives the basic reason for the failure of objectivism. So understood, the argument closes a gap. We noticed that the metaphysical argument simply assumed that moral goodness could not be a simple objective property, and so left room for Price’s view (later revived by Moore). The practical argument closes this gap; a simple objective property would not be essentially connected with motivation, and hence could not be the moral property. Price and Moore can exploit the metaphysical argument to show that goodness is not a complex property describable by some predicate other than ‘good’, and can still maintain an objectivist conclusion. But they cannot so easily maintain objectivism against the metaphysical argument supported by the practical argument.
