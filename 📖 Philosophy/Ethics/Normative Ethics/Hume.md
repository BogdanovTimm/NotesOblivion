- Role of a rational part of the soul is only an instrumental one
- It is not rational to plan the better way of fullfilling the desire
- Rejects the supremacy of reasons based on one’s own good for being moral
- Holistic Naturalism (Human nature os a system of some tendencies of people. But not all tendencies are part of human nature) is false. Hume does not believe that all claims about human nature must be excluded from moral philosophy, but he rejects the naturalist position that we have outlined. Everything whar people do is a human's nature
- Hume anticipates many of Nietzsche’s alleged ‘insights’; he attacks emphasis on ‘morality’ and responsibility without even knowing about Kant, who is a primary target of Nietzsche, MacIntyre, and Williams.
- Virtues of character are sufficient to be virtuous
- In unself i sh concern A wants to do x for B, simply because B wants x done or because it would be better for B, not because A gains any further benef i t from doing x. A shows this concern for B if A moves to one side to avoid walking over B’s gouty toes, when A has nothing else to gain by doing this. This is the unself i sh sentiment whose reality Hume (e.g.) defend against the psychological egoism of Hobbes
- In his view, the difference between simply entertaining a proposition and believing it consists in the degree of vividness with which you entertain it; it is an introspectible property of the idea itself.
- He argues that the attempt to f i nd a rational basis for moral beliefs is a philosophical undertaking whose failure makes no difference to the ordinary way we hold our beliefs. Just as our belief that the sun will rise tomorrow is undisturbed even when we see that it lacks rational justif i cation, our moral sentiments are unaffected even when we see that they lack rational foundation.
- Sentimentalism is true: the extent to which we are capable of sympathy defines the extent of concern.
- The anti-rationalist position of Hutcheson claims that the different specific ends people pursue reflect their different desires, inclinations, and attitudes, and must ultimately be explained by these, rather than by their different rational beliefs about anything.
- Hume accepts compatibilism, but does not believe that it removes objections to predestination. 
- false judgments cannot be the source of immorality
- freedom consists simply in internal determination; he sees no relevant distinction between the will and the ‘sentiments’ or ‘passions’ as sources of the internal determination.
He rejects both an indeterminist and an intellectualist account of freedom.¹⁸ Though he accepts the voluntarist criticisms of intellectualism far enough to believe that determination by intellect is not freedom, he does not regard voluntarism as an adequate alternative.
Against both intellectualists and voluntarists, he concludes that the will is a passion. 
- Hume’s argument about ‘is’ and ‘ought’:
we have given the wrong account of a moral judgment if our account allows someone to believe that a moral judgment is true without having any motive to act on it.
- Hume believes that justice is appropriate only in specific external circumstances that do not follow from human nature itself.⁷⁰ The competition that leads to a state of war results from human nature only in conditions of scarcity. 
- Hume intends his moral sense theory to express anti-realism and the rejection of independent morality. HE believes that he continues and develops Hutcheson’s approach to morality, and especially his account of the moral sense
- oppose theological voluntarism. 
- Later believers in a moral sense, Hume and Hutcheson, reject moral realism
- Since the only intelligible account of moral properties makes them dependent on the reactions of the moral sense, our view that they are non-arbitrary and immutable in certain ways turns out to be unjustified.⁵⁶
- Balguy’s criticism of Hutcheson convinces not only Butler and Price, but also Hume.
For Hume implicitly agrees that Hutcheson cannot combine his sentimentalist objections to Clarke with his realist defence of Shaftesbury, because his sentimentalism conflicts with realism. Butler and Price argue that in the face of this we should give up sentimentalism, but Hume decides to give up realism instead.
- Both Hume and Price notice that Hutcheson’s position on authority is unsatisfactory. In Hume’s view, the concession to Butler is a mistake. In Price’s view, Hutcheson is right to agree with Butler, but wrong to suppose that the moral sense meets Butler’s conditions for an authoritative principle.²⁰ Both critics argue, from their opposite points of view, that Hutcheson can restore consistency to his position only by moving either to a more rationalist or to a more anti-rationalist view.
- The normative pretensions of previous moral philosophy appear to Hume to be misguided. But why does he think so? In claiming that the science of man allows us to ‘conquer’ the sciences that more intimately concern human life, he might mean that the experimental study of human nature provides a basis for better-founded normative claims about how human beings ought to be. Alternatively, he might mean that experimental study conquers moral philosophy by expelling the normative element that is distinct from experimental study. We need to see which of these two views expresses Hume’s claim about the significance of experimental moral science.
- Sometimes, however, Hume attacks the basis of common-sense beliefs. His discussion of induction seems to affect the rational basis of all our beliefs about ‘matters of fact’. His argument about personal identity seems to attack not only metaphysical theories of personal identity, but also the belief that I am the same person through the normal changes in my mental states. Similarly, the sceptical discussion of the senses casts doubt on both the vulgar belief and the more circumspect (as Hume supposes) philosophical belief in external objects.
Hume takes his scepticism to be pervasive, since it shows that our beliefs about causes and effects and our beliefs about external objects undermine each other (i 4.7, 4). But we cannot give up either of these sets of beliefs.
- If Hume’s premisses seem to lead by valid arguments to absurd conclusions, ought we to doubt the truth of his premisses? Hume does not think so. In his view, sceptical philosophy and common sense are in permanent tension. Sceptical arguments encourage him to reject all beliefs.⁵ Common life does not refute the sceptical arguments, but it weakens their influence.
Since we have to act, we cannot (he claims) maintain complete suspension of belief.
Still, sceptical philosophy changes our attitude to our common-sense beliefs. If we are sceptics, we recognize that we hold our ordinary beliefs because they are entrenched and we cannot easily get rid of them, not because we think the evidence warrants them.⁶ This is not our normal attitude—before we become sceptics—to our everyday beliefs. If we agree with Hume that sceptical arguments undermine the justification of everyday beliefs, we cannot turn our back on sceptical conclusions when we engage in the activities of everyday life.
- A sceptical point of view does not undermine every impulse to philosophical inquiry, but it changes the character of the inquiry. If we are sceptics, we ask psychological rather than normative questions. Instead of asking what is morally good or bad, we ask what causes us to judge one thing good and another bad. 
- The experimental method allows us to construct this science of man that makes no claims about ultimate reality, and does not go beyond the ordinary claims of common life. Even if we are sceptics about the objective truth of claims about the world, our scepticism does not spread to claims about our propensities and tendencies. For the relevant claims belong to the science of human nature, which survives Hume’s sceptical doubts.⁹ 
- Is Hume entitled to assume that the ‘pre-sceptical’ science of human nature that we use to argue for sceptical conclusions is the same science as the ‘post-sceptical’ science that investigates the questions that survive sceptical conclusions? In his view, the pre-sceptical and the post-sceptical science are the same, because each is an empirical investigation of human abilities. Past philosophers have told us that we can know the world as it really is; in order to know it, we need certain cognitive capacities. The pre-sceptical science of human nature assures us that we lack these capacities, so that it is futile to seek knowledge of the world as it really is. But since the science of human nature tells us about our capacities, we can continue asking about our capacities even when we realize we cannot learn about the world as it really is. The psychological investigation of human capacities—both pre-sceptical and post-sceptical—is not a normative inquiry, and it does not try to answer normative questions about whether we are justified in believing in causes, or necessary connexion, or an external world. 
- This description shows that the science of man is insufficient for Hume’s sceptical conclusions. In Book i his case for scepticism depends on his claims about the cognitive capacities we need in order to acquire knowledge of the world as it is. He claims, for instance, that if we are justified in believing that causal connexions in the world are more than constant conjunctions, we need an impression of necessary connexion in the world.
Psychological inquiry shows us (in his view) that we have no such impression. But some argument going beyond psychological inquiry is needed to show that we need such an impression if we are to believe justifiably in causation. Such argument seems to belong to metaphysics and epistemology. Hence the discipline that Hume practises in order to reach sceptical conclusions does not seem to be the purely psychological science of human nature that answers his post-sceptical questions.
The purely psychological science of human nature, therefore, cannot assure us that the only questions worth asking are those that this science of human nature can answer. To convince ourselves to restrict our questions to the science of human nature, we need arguments in metaphysics and epistemology. 
- Rationalism and objectivism, the two positions that he rejects, imply that moral judgments express knowledge of an objective reality. 
- Hume believes that, once we consider our reasoning capacities and the character of our moral judgments, we can see that we lack the sort of access to objective moral properties that we would need if we were entitled to make objectivist claims. Experimental science of human nature shows us that we lack the capacity to find eternal fitnesses, just as we lack the capacity to find objective causal relations.
The refutation of these objectivist philosophical theories of morality does not, in Hume’s view, imply any doubt about morality itself. On the contrary, we may find it reassuring and clarifying to recognize that our moral judgments do not collapse in the face of a refutation of philosophicaltheoriesthatprofesstofindsomedeeperfoundationforthem.Sincethetheories are controversial, it is a good thing that our moral judgments do not rely on their truth.
- Hume’s attitude is more similar to Machiavelli’s view that the ‘monkish’ mediaeval moralists have corrupted the sound morality of pagan antiquity.¹⁸ In this contrast between healthy paganism and the errors introduced by mediaeval Christianity, Hume anticipates Hegel and Nietzsche. But he differs from them about where to find the healthy paganism. Hume finds it in Hellenistic ethics, and specifically in Cicero’s account ofit. Heshowsvery littleacquaintancewiththeethical viewsofPlatoandAristotle. 
- Hume’s claims about what the ancients say and mean are brief, but significant; they sketch some of the main features of his own position. He suggests that if we practise the science of man, we will take an experimental approach to human nature, we will be anti-rationalists about action and virtue, and we will abandon the normative pretensions of moral philosophy, both in our claims about human nature and in our claims about the virtues.  
- Hume draws one of his sharpest contrasts between the ancients and the ‘monkish’ writers in discussing the claim that the moral virtues are voluntary states. He believes that this claim reflects ignorance of the experimental method. It introduces an unprofitable dispute that can be resolved by attention to facts about human nature. In Hume’s view, the ancients are right to avoid this dispute, because they do not separate moral from non-moral virtues. A dispute about which virtues are strictly moral is purely verbal. No significant issue rests on a sharp division between genuine moral virtues and other qualities that we may find attractive or admirable to some degree.
In taking this position Hume disagrees not only with earlier Christian moralists, but apparently also with Hutcheson. In Hutcheson’s view, the distinctively moral virtues must be founded on benevolence, and he criticizes Hume for allowing natural abilities and other non-voluntary states unrelated to benevolence to count as virtues. Hume takes this to be an artificial and misleading restriction of ‘virtue’.²⁴
- At first sight, Hutcheson and Hume agree with Butler in believing that morality is natural, but reject his belief that morality is rational. They deny that moral judgments and sentiments are simply devices to secure the self-interest of Hobbesian agents; they take morality to have a broader foundation in the operations of human nature and human mental life in general.
Hume, agreeing with Hutcheson, accepts Butler’s objections to psychological hedonist egoism,⁴³ and treats Butler’s argument as an example of the ways in which philosophical investigation of human nature can lead to a more accurate understanding of the basis of morality. 
- But even if Hume agrees with Butler’s claim that some actions are naturally appropriate for a human being, he disagrees about which actions these are. In Butler’s view, two claims about naturalness are closely connected: (1) What is natural for a human being is what is appropriate for the whole system that constitutes a human being. (2) For a human being as a rational agent, it is appropriate to act in accordance with superior principles appealing to authority rather than strength. Hume accepts neither of these claims.
Butler’s first claim assumes that a human being is a system, as opposed to a collection or aggregate of traits, capacities, and desires. We must recognize this system before we can identify principles that aim at the good of the system as a whole. But some of Hume’s other claims commit him to the denial of this belief in a system. According to Hume, a human self is simply a collection of mental states and episodes, no subset of which constitutes the essential or fundamental self. We cannot consider or protect the fundamental persistent characteristics of the numerically identical self, since there is no such self and there are no such characteristics.
Perhaps we ought not to introduce Hume’s sceptical arguments about personal identity.
He does not suggest that his arguments in moral philosophy presuppose his scepticism about personal identity. On the contrary, he allows that the idea of the self accompanies many passions.⁵⁷ But he does not make any of the claims about a person as a system that support Butler’s claims about natural action. He may recognize that Butler’s view involves claims about the self that are too robust for Hume’s position.⁵⁸ Since Hume rejects Butler’s claims about the self, he also rejects Butler’s precise distinction between rational self-love and the particular passions. Though he accepts a part of Butler’s argument in favour of benevolence (IPM 9.20),⁵⁹ he omits Butler’s claim that self-love is concerned with the whole self as opposed to particular objects of desire. The deliberations of self-love seem to assume something like Butler’s conception of its aim and object.⁶⁰ But Hume’s outlook leaves no room for such a conception. He needs to explain self-love with reference to the agent’s predominant desires, not with reference to the whole self.⁶¹
- Hume explicitly disagrees with Hutcheson on the authority of conscience;⁶³ he implicitly disagrees with him on the rationality of prudence. According to Hume, reason does not guide us to act in accordance with human nature. None of the distinctive operations that Butler attributes to self-love is especially characteristic of reason. Hence, it is not distinctively rational to take the point of view of self-love. For Butler, rational self-love has special insight into what is required for the benefit of the system that constitutes human nature. For Hume, there is no such system, and there is no distinctively rational self-love. Even if our nature requires certain kinds of actions, reason gives us no special access to them. In disagreeing with Butler about reason and natural action, Hume relies on his treatment of passion and reason. 
- Hume agrees with Hobbes in rejecting the division between passion and will. He sees that if we reject this division, we undermine Hobbes’s belief in a special connexion between practical reason, will, and concern for one’s overall good. Hobbes’s belief is a Scholastic remnant, conflicting with the rest of Hobbes’s position. Hume removes the conflict.
Hisanalysisofthepassionseliminatestheaspectsofapassionthat allowrationalevaluation and guidance. Aquinas believes that a passion is tractable because it includes an appearance of the goodness of its object, even though it does not rest on a belief about universal good.
Hobbes retains this feature of Aquinas’ account, since he takes each passion to involve its distinctive form of appetite or aversion, and therefore its distinctive view of something as good or bad (L. 6.2, 7). Hume, however, separates the passion from any appearance of goodness, taking the relation to be purely contingent. This aspect of his analysis explains some of his most surprising claims about the passions and their objects 
- Hume distinguishes the cause from the object of a given passion, and within the cause he further distinguishes the subject and the quality (T ii 1.2.6).⁴ Since he takes causal relations to hold between ‘objects’, usually understood as events, we might take the subject (for instance, a house) and its quality (splendour) to be different constituents of the event that is the cause. Perhaps the object is a state of affairs or fact, so that I take pride in, say, the fact that I have a splendid house, or in my having a splendid house.
But when he speaks of the object of a passion, Hume does not refer to anything as complex as a fact or state of affairs. He seems to refer to the particular item in the world to which one’s passion is directed. Hence he takes pride and humility to have the same object, oneself.⁵ If we identified the cause with the object (as Hume understands ‘object’), and distinguished passions by their objects, we would have to say that pride and humility are the same passion, because they have the same object. They are different, however, because they have different causes. Hume does not consider a description of the object of pride as ‘something good about myself’ or ‘the fact that I am suitably connected to something good’, or a suitably different description of humility. 
- Hume’s views about the individuation of passions, and their logical independence from causes and objects, are even clearer from some of his remarks about love and hatred. In his view, benevolence and anger are only contingently accompanied by love and hatred, ‘by the original constitution of the mind’ (ii 2.6 6). The relation that actually holds between love and benevolence ‘abstractly considered, is not necessary’, because the sensations of love and hatred could have existed without any desire, or connected with the opposite desires.⁸ This division between the sensation and the desire implies that the sensation is the essential feature of the passion, contingently connected with the desire. This same view explains why passions are only contingently associated with their objects and causes.⁹ According to this view, the sensation that we now have when we wish well to other people would still be love if it were conjoined with a desire to harm them or with complete indifference to their interests.
Hume may be right to claim that the sensation is part of the passion. The mere desire to benefit others is not enough for the passion of love, since we might have the desire for various reasons that would not cause the passion. But it does not follow that the desire is inessential to the passion. Hume’s claim that the sensation is logically separable from the desire does not justify his claim that the mere sensation is the passion. 
- Hume cannot allow this criticism of a passion, if the appearance of goodness is not an essential property of the passion itself, but simply part of the cause. Since beliefs can affect passions, the recognition that I have nothing to be proud of may cause me to abandon the passion.¹¹ But my recognition does not warrant criticism of my pride, since the belief or appearance of something to be proud of is not essential to the passion. The passion may be modified if we no longer attribute the property we used to attribute to its cause; but this is not criticism of the passion, but simply manipulation of it. Since the appearance of goodness is not part of the passion, an unreasonable or foolish appearance does not make a passion unreasonable or foolish. 
- Hume’s account of the passions, therefore, leaves open the possibility of causal influence, rather than rational criticism and evaluation, by the rational will.¹² But Hume does not exploit this possibility, since he does not separate the rational will from the passions; he argues that the will is a passion, with no essential connexion to practical reason. This is Hume’s version of Hobbes’s claim that the will is simply the last appetite in deliberation.
Hume’s version rests on a more precise account of a passion.
Hume takes himself to oppose a widespread view about the role of practical reason.¹³ Though he does not mention Hutcheson, he defends Hutcheson’s view that neither exciting nor justifying reasons can be derived from reason. But in contrast to Hutcheson, Hume suggests that his view ‘may appear somewhat extraordinary’ (ii 3.3.4).¹⁴ He presents himself as an innovator challenging a consensus in favour of rationalism. Hutcheson, however, believes that this anti-rationalist view simply reasserts a Scholastic and Aristotelian view against modern rationalists.¹⁵ 
- Hume needs to defend two claims: (1) The source of justifying and exciting reasons is not reason itself. (2) The source is passion. To reach the second claim from the first we must assume that the only two conceivable ‘influencing motives of the will’ are passion and reason, and that if reason fails, only passion is left. Hume assumes this; he devotes his efforts to a defence of his first claim, and says little to defend the dichotomy that underlies the second claim.¹⁹ The assumptions that support the dichotomy are doubtful. Aquinas, for instance, believes that reason does not move us by itself, but does not infer that passion must be the only mover; for will, as Aquinas conceives it, is neither reason nor passion. If Hume conceives reason broadly, perhaps Aquinas’ position fits into his dichotomy; but then we may need to reconsider the soundness of his argument to show that reason does not give us justifying or exciting reasons. What, then, does Hume mean by his first claim, and how does he defend it? 
- To show that reason cannot provide justifying or exciting reasons, Hume claims to describe all the functions of reason, and then points out that these functions do not include exciting or justifying reasons.²⁰ He allows only two functions: (a) Reason points out that a desire rests on some false supposition, so that I desire x as F (F is x’s desirability-characteristic), and reason points out to me that x is not F. (b) Reason points out to me that a desire for x as a means to y rests on a false supposition that x is in fact a means sufficient for y. The second function of reason is an instance of the first, informing me that the object of my desire lacks some feature that I thought it had, and that was the basis of my desiring it. Hume does not imply that whenever reason informs me that I have made a mistake about the properties of x, my desire for x will go away. He implies that if I thought x was G, discover that it is not G, but still desire it, then I did not desire x as G.²¹
- What sorts of reasons does Hume’s argument cover? Hutcheson argues: (1) Reason provides no exciting reason; every action is caused by some desire that is independent of reason. (2) Reason provides no justifying reason: appeal to reason cannot show that one action deserves approval over another (except within the limits fixed by the functions of reason). Hume agrees with Hutcheson on exciting reasons, since he claims that ‘reason alone can never be a motive to any action of the will’. He also seems to agree on justifying reasons. His claim that reason ‘can never oppose passion in the direction of the will’ includes justifying reasons, if ‘direction’ refers to prescriptions as well as to actual motivation.
Moreover, Hume’s account of the functions of reason undermines a justifying as well as an exciting role for reason alone.²² In saying that what reason alone tells us cannot ‘concern’ us without some presupposed desire, he refers implicitly to justifying reasons. In saying that a desire must be presupposed before the objects of reason are ‘able to affect us’, he refers to exciting reasons.²³ If Hume has identified the only two possible functions of reason, he has shown why Hutcheson is right: (1) Reason cannot by itself provide exciting reasons, since the two kinds of reasoning Hume recognizes cannot themselves motivate without some antecedent desire for an end about which reason discovers these facts. Simply discovering that x is F, or that x is a sufficient means to y does not move me to pursue x unless I already care about x’s being F or being a means to y. (2) Nor can reason by itself provide justifying reasons; for the information that reason gives does not show that this or that action deserves to be approved.
If I find that x is a sufficient means to y, I still have no justifying reason to approve x, unless I already want y. If reason supports my approval of x, I presuppose some prior approval of y, resting on some desire for y as an end or on some approval of y that in turn rests on a desire for some further end.

If reason supports my approval of x, I presuppose some prior approval of y, resting on some desire for y as an end or on some approval of y that in turn rests on a desire for some further end.
The narrow scope of reason implies that reason can prescribe neither the choice of an end nor the choice of the best means to an end. If I could book a flight from New York to London on one airline for $600 and on another airline for $700, and the two flights and airlines are otherwise equal, reason, as Hume understands it, is indifferent between them.
Hume is right, given his view of the functions of reason, to deny that the preference for efficiency is rational. The choice of the best and most efficient means presupposes some preference for prudence and foresight, but this preference is not based on reason. 
- Hume does not deny that we might have a desire directed towards our longer-term rather than our shorter-term interest; we must have such a desire if we ever prefer the scratching of our finger to the destruction of the world. But he maintains that this is not a distinctively rational desire.
- Reason, therefore, cannot provide justifying reasons for the pursuit of one end over another.²⁴ Hume recognizes ‘the maxims of common prudence and discretion’ that advise us on how to achieve our various ends, by identifying instrumental means to them. But he argues that reason can provide nothing more.²⁵ The Sceptic claims that reason is incapable of discovering that anything is valuable in itself, and hence of justifying any ultimate ends.²⁶ He defends his claims about ultimate ends, first from ‘diversity of sentiment’, and then from the arguments in the Treatise about the source of moral distinctions. Hume’s discussions of reason and passion and of moral distinctions have the common aim of undermining the conception of the philosopher as a ‘cunning man’ who can tell us which ends are worth pursuing, independently of whether we already pursue them or not. In denying that the philosopher is a ‘cunning man’, Hume denies that reason can provide justifying reasons independent of antecedent passions. 
- Hume makes clear a point that Hutcheson leaves implicit, that he intends to go beyond Aristotle’sclaimthatthoughtdoesnotmoveuswithoutdesire.⁴⁴Inrejectingpurerationalism about motivation Aristotle agrees with Hume that reason by itself cannot move us to action without desire; but he does not say that the desire that needs to be added to reason is desire that is independent of reason. The desire that Aristotle adds to reason is the desire for happiness, which is an essentially rational desire, open to modification through reflexion on the good. This sort of desire presupposes functions for practical reason that Hume denies.
And so Hume’s denial that reason provides exciting reasons is more extreme than the apparently similar claims of Aristotle and Aquinas. He does not mean only that reason needs desire before we are moved to action; he also claims that the only source of motivation is desire without reason. In his view, a practical reason cannot modify a desire for an end, because the functions of reason do not apply to desire for ends. His claim about exciting reasons rests on his account of the functions of reason; but we have seen that this account does not refute Butler’s position. 
- The Treatise appears to accept hard determinism, since it defends a doctrine of necessity and determinism that Hume takes to conflict with a belief in liberty. The Inquiry takes a compatibilist position, claiming that liberty, on any reasonable understanding of it, is not ruled out by necessity, on any reasonable understanding of it.⁴⁶ 
- Hume implicitly acknowledges that one might defend a doctrine of liberty as spontaneity without indifference, but he develops this point only in the Inquiry.⁴⁸ 
- Even in the Treatise, where he is an incompatibilist about determinism and freedom, he is a compatibilist about determinism and responsibility. In his view, to be responsible is to be an object of moral sentiments, and in particular of praise, blame, gratitude, anger, love, hatred. Determinism does not undermine these sentiments; indeed, we cannot be objects of these sentiments unless our characters and dispositions causally determine our actions (T ii 3.2.6). 
- his claim that actions ‘out of character’ are not objects of praise and blame. The criticism is especially justified given that he claims to describe our actual reactions, not to tell us what reactions we ought to have. 
- change of character removes responsibility for past actions. 
- Hume takes his practical argument to undermine every purely cognitive view of morality.
He mentions three claims: (1) Virtue is ‘nothing but a conformity to reason’. (2) There are eternal fitnesses that ‘are the same to every rational being that considers them’. (3) Right and wrong impose an obligation on God as well as on human beings.³ Hume speaks as though he is considering only views that treat moral judgments as a priori knowledge of ‘relations of ideas’ (as Hume calls them). Clarke and Price hold such views, but it is not clear that Butler agrees with them. Hume’s argument is not confined, however, to conceptions of moral judgments as a priori; it seems to extend to all purely cognitive views (iii 1.1.26). According to such views, we can know that an action is right or wrong by knowing some fact about the world that is not constituted by the thoughts or feelings of the subject who knows. 
- But even if Hume’s objection rests on a dubious assumption, it may still expose a flaw in Clarke’s rationalism. To meet Hume’s objection, we need to maintain that the relation of ingratitude that holds between voluntary agents is crucially different from the ‘same’ relation that holds between non-voluntary agents. But why should this be, if the wrongness consists in the contradictoriness, rather than in the agents involved in the contradiction? Why should we pick out one instance of contradiction and neglect others? Clarke and Wollaston do not answer this question.
- After Hume has denied that moral judgments are about any matter of fact ‘in the object’, he says what they are really about.³⁶ Though we may suppose we attribute some property to the external situation, we are really talking about our feeling of approval or disapproval.
The objectivist makes the mistake we would make if we thought that irritating people have a special property of irritatingness that they have independently of whether they irritate other people. But in fact, when we say that an action is right or wrong, we really refer both to the non-moral properties of the action, distinct from its rightness or wrongness, and to our sentiment towards the action 
- He therefore attacks not only the cognitivist views of moral properties that take moral knowledge to be demonstrative, but also those that take it to be non-demonstrative knowledge about matters of fact. Since the paragraph on ‘is’ and ‘ought’ (27) is so closely connected with this one (26), it applies to the claim that non-deductive inferences about matters of fact grasped by reason can justify moral conclusions.
Hume might be taken to intend any one of these arguments: (1) The transition from ‘is’ to ‘ought’ not only ‘seems altogether inconceivable’ but is indeed altogether inconceivable; for if we could make this transition, we would show that moral distinctions are matters of fact grasped by reason. (2) What seems inconceivable is not inconceivable. We can make the transition if and only if we supply the right kind of ‘is’, referring to the feeling of the spectator. The fact that we need to supply this kind of ‘is’ shows that the cognitivist position is mistaken.⁴⁸ (3) What seems inconceivable is inconceivable. But what seems inconceivable is not every transition from ‘is’ to ‘ought’, but the transition from ‘is’ judgments about God or human affairs to ‘ought’ judgments. In this instance, the ‘ought’ expresses some new relation or affirmation that is illegitimate, because the relations from which one claims to derive it are entirely different from it. But ‘is’ statements about the feelings of the spectator refer to relations that are not entirely different from those referred to in ‘ought’ statements, and in these cases the transition to ‘ought’ is legitimate.
- It is difficult to decide between these accounts of Hume’s challenge, because he leaves some other aspects of his position quite uncertain. It is especially difficult to decide what he includes in ‘is’ and ‘is not’. He should not include all sentences containing ‘is’ without ‘ought’; for if he included them all, he would count ‘x is good’ and ‘x is right’ as ‘is’ judgments.
But he does not suggest that the transition from ‘It is right for me to do x’ to ‘I ought to do x’ is questionable. Hence, he does not count judgments including ‘is good’ and ‘is right’ as ‘is judgments’.
But how many other judgments are to be ruled out? What about judgments involving (so-called) ‘thick’ moral concepts, such as ‘This is brave’, or ‘This is considerate’ or ‘This is deliberate and unprovoked murder’? One might argue that these are ‘is’ judgments, and that from them some ‘ought’ judgments can be legitimately derived (if they are understood as ‘ought, some things considered’ or ‘ought, unless something more important counts against it’). These judgments raise a question parallel to the question that arose from Hume’s claim that we can know all the properties of an action in itself without knowing whether it is right or wrong. If he disallows the predicates we have mentioned, by objecting that they allow the derivation of an ‘ought’ judgment and so cannot be ‘is’ judgments, he argues in a circle.
But if he does not disallow them on this ground, we seem to have found ‘is’ judgments that give us a legitimate transition to ‘ought’. 
- But let us waive this objection, and assume (contrary to fact) that we can satisfactorily identify the non-evaluative predicates that are allowed to appear in ‘is’ judgments. Hume may intend a further restriction of ‘is’. The only examples of ‘is’ judgments that he gives are about the existence of a God or ‘human affairs’. These are judgments about external objects.
They are also judgments about matters of fact, but they are not the only such judgments.
When we find a ‘sentiment of disapprobation’, this is a matter of fact, but ‘an object of feeling, not of reason’. Hence some matters of fact are not objects of reason. He has also previously allowed this in saying that morality does not consist ‘in any matter of fact, which can be discovered by the understanding’ (26). The ‘which’ clause leaves open the possibility of other matters of fact, and this possibility is actualized in the reference to matters of fact that are objects of feeling.
Here Hume denies that the moral property is a property of, say, the wilful murder itself.
But he does not make it clear whether matters of fact that are objects of feeling can be described in ‘is’ statements. He commits himself more definitely in his summary of the argument about ‘is’ and ‘ought’, when he asserts that the distinction of vice and virtue is not founded merely on the relations of ‘objects’.⁴⁹ If this assertion states the point of the argument about ‘is’ and ‘ought’, we would expect ‘is’ judgments to be judgments about ‘objects’. Now he could hardly deny that it is founded on relations of objects, if ‘objects of feeling’ count as objects; for he has not denied that moral properties are founded on relations of actions to sentiments. Hence he uses ‘objects’ in the more restrictive sense that he used in saying that the vice escapes us as long as we consider the object (26). He means ‘external objects’, in contrast to the ‘objects of feeling’ that we find when we turn our reflexion into our own breast.
- Hume, therefore, seems to identify objective states of affairs with ‘objects of reason’, ‘any matter of fact which can be discovered by the understanding’, and ‘matters of fact whose existence we can infer by reason’. These are a proper subset of matters of fact. He does not explicitly say whether the proper subset or the whole set is described by ‘is’ judgments. But if the argument about ‘is’ and ‘ought’ shows something about inferences from objective states of affairs to moral conclusions, the ‘is’ judgments should be about objective states of affairs.
This is still not quite right, however. We might take objective states of affairs to be contrasted with subjective conditions whose existence depends on the mental state of the subject of the condition. But Hume takes some of these subjective conditions to be among conditions that are ‘in the object’. For judgments about matters of fact ‘in the object’ include judgments about ‘certain passions, motives, volitions and thoughts’ (26). Hence these should also be ‘is’ judgments.
Perhaps, then, Hume takes ‘is’ judgments to include judgments about subjective states of subjects other than the subject making the judgment. When I make judgments about other people’s mental states, the truth of my judgment does not depend on my thoughts and feelings (though it depends on theirs); hence these are judgments about ‘the object’ and are ‘is’ judgments. They are included among the ‘is’ judgments from which people claim to derive ‘ought’ judgments. Hume’s contrast is intelligible, if ‘is’ judgments involve the facts of the situation (including the mental states of the agents involved) apart from the reaction of an observer who makes these judgments. While this narrow use of ‘is’ and this broad use of ‘in the objects’ may confuse us, it is not surprising. Hume takes the scope of ‘is’ judgments to be defined by the claims of the ‘vulgar systems’ that he sets out to refute. 
- If this is Hume’s conception of ‘is’ judgments, what is his answer to his question about deriving ‘ought’ from ‘is’? We might suppose that he thinks the vulgar systems fail to derive ‘ought’ from ‘is’ because they do not set out from the right ‘is’ judgments; they would derive ‘ought’ successfully, on this view, if the ‘is’ judgments included ‘is’ judgments about the reactions of the subject.⁵⁰ This view of Hume’s conclusion, however, conflicts with his restriction of ‘is’ judgments to facts about ‘the object’ in the sense we have explained.
Probably, then, Hume claims that ‘ought’ cannot be derived from ‘is’. Admittedly, he says only that the derivation ‘seems altogether inconceivable’, not that it is inconceivable. But he says it seems altogether inconceivable ‘how this new relation can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it’. He claims that the relation involved in ‘is’ judgments is entirely different from the relation involved in ‘ought’ judgments, not merely that it seems entirely different. If he allowed ‘is’ judgments to include judgments about our reactions, the relations they involve would not be entirely different from those involved in ‘ought’ judgments. Hence he does not treat judgments about our reactions as ‘is’ judgments. He confines ‘is’ judgments to those about objective states of affairs, those that involve ‘relations of objects’. His account of moral judgments does not embody a legitimate transition from ‘is’ to ‘ought’, since it does not involve a derivation of the ‘ought’ relation from others that are entirely different from it. The ‘ought’ judgment is not derived from ‘is’ judgments alone, but from ‘is’ judgments plus judgments about our reactions.
But what is the ‘ought’ judgment? In declaring that moral properties are objects of feeling rather than reason, Hume compares them with the Lockean view (as Hutcheson understands it)⁵¹ that secondary qualities ‘are not qualities in objects but perceptions in the mind’ (iii 1.1.26). If this parallel is exact, moral properties are also perceptions in the mind. In that case, they are not feelings and reactions, but judgments about them, just as the judgment that something is red is not itself the sensation of red. Since Hume takes a belief to be simply ‘a lively idea, related to or associated with a present impression’ (i 3.7.5), a moral judgment should be the lively idea associated with the sentiment of approval or disapproval.
If this view is right, Hume takes his discussion of ‘is’ and ‘ought’ to show that moral judgments are beliefs with a particular subject-matter, and that they are expressed by statements; they report and describe the spectator’s reaction to actions and people.
- A non-cognitivist interpretation gains only superficial support from Hume’s use of ‘is’ and ‘ought’. We have seen that his use of ‘is’ in the relevant contexts narrows the range of ‘is’ judgments to only a subset of statements containing ‘is’. When I describe my own feelings, I make a statement, but I do not make one of Hume’s ‘is’ judgments. The fact that he contrasts ‘ought’ with ‘is’ does not show that he means to distinguish the imperative from the indicative. 
- A better argument for a non-cognitivist interpretation rests on Hume’s practical argument.
This argument succeeds only if moral judgments by themselves are practical. But Hume’s argument about reason and passion implies that the only mental items that are practical by themselves are passions. Hence moral judgments must be passions. If judgments about passions are distinguishable from passions, they do not motivate us in their own right. Even if they are simply lively ideas accompanying present impressions, and therefore inseparable from the passions they accompany, they depend on the passions for motivation. The practical argument, therefore, favours a non-cognitivist interpretation.
If this is true, the practical and the metaphysical argument seem to favour different conclusions. The passage on ‘is’ and ‘ought’ sums up the metaphysical argument. It concludes that moral judgments are beliefs about one’s sentiments, not about objective facts. The practical argument suggests that moral judgments are really not beliefs at all, but sentiments. The difference between these accounts of moral judgments may not be clear to Hume. He argues that ‘the vice entirely escapes you, as long as you consider the object’ (iii 1.1.26); this is true whichever way he treats moral judgments. But it is not clear whether we make the moral judgment in describing and reporting our sentiment or in feeling it. 
- It is reasonable, then, for non-cognitivists to claim that Hume has anticipated them, and their claims should not be dismissed as anachronistic.⁵³ They ought not to claim that Hume is a non-cognitivist, since some of his arguments seem to support a subjectivist descriptive view of moral judgments. But they are right to claim that he offers arguments that support a non-cognitivist conclusion. The argument about ‘is’ and ‘ought’ supports non-cognitivism no better than it supports subjectivism, but the practical argument supports non-cognitivism. 
- The difference between subjectivism and non-cognitivism is probably not obvious to Hume, partly because it is not always clear whether he is discussing moral properties or moral virtues or moral judgments. He sets out from the general claim that ‘morals’ influence action, and his doctrine seeks to embody this claim by showing that ‘morals’ essentially include sentiments, so that we miss moral goodness and badness until we attend to our sentiments. But this might be true either because:
    * ‘morals’ are moral judgments, which are essentially sentiments (non-cognitivism). The practical argument favours a non-cognitivist view. 
    * ‘morals’ are moral properties, which are sentiments, whereas moral judgments are first-person beliefs about these sentiments (subjectivism). Hume’s metaphysical argument and his discussion of ‘is’ and ‘ought’ favour a subjectivist view
- After rejecting cognitivist and objectivist views, Hume maintains that moral distinctions are not derived from reason, but from a moral sense. We must turn our reflexion into our own breast (iii 1.1.26), to our sentiments of approval and disapproval. This reference to our approval and disapproval introduces a moral sense.
ThisconclusionrestsindifferentwaysonHume’spracticalandhismetaphysicalargument.
Only the practical argument shows that the moral sense itself makes the moral judgment, because there is nothing to the moral judgment beyond the feeling of approval that belongs to the moral sense. This is Hume’s position, if he sees the connexion between internalism and non-cognitivism. He relies on his view that ‘morals’ influence passions and actions.
In saying this he might intend either of two claims: (1) The existence of moral goodness involves someone’s having a motive to act on it. (2) The judgment that an action is morally good involves being motivated to do it.
The first view makes goodness something like sound, on the assumption that there are no unheard sounds. It would not be possible, on this view, for an action to be morally good if no one felt approval for it, since this feeling of approval is necessary (according to Hume) for motivation. The second view does not make this claim about moral properties directly, but appeals to the connexion between moral judgments and motivation.
The metaphysical argument also introduces the moral sense. It argues that moral properties do not consist in matters of fact ‘in the object’, independent of the reactions of the spectator; hence objectivism is false. Moral properties consist at least in part in the feelings of a spectator, and these feelings, in Hume’s view, belong to a moral sense. It does not follow, however, from this argument that moral judgments are the reactions of a moral sense. Our grasp of moral properties might be purely cognitive, not involving any feeling of approval;
it might be a report of the reactions of observers, either ourselves or other people. If I am both the judge and the observer, my moral judgment reports my feeling of approval, but the judgment may be distinct from the feeling of approval. 
- We have also noticed a version of the metaphysical argument that relies on the practical argument: (1) If a moral judgment were wholly about a (purported) a matter of fact in the object, it would be logically possible for us to recognize that matter of fact without being motivated by it. (2) If this were logically possible, moral judgments would not involve motivation. (3) Hence moral judgments cannot be wholly about any property of the object itself. If this is Hume’s argument, he assumes that the motivating character of moral judgments is a logically necessary truth derived from the content of the judgments themselves. He cannot agree that it is a contingent truth about the making of the judgments in normal circumstances. This is the version of the metaphysical argument that Hume offers in ‘The Sceptic’.¹ 
- Whichever of these accounts of Hume’s arguments is correct, his conclusion rejects objectivism; he denies that moral goodness and badness, rightness and wrongness, consist in any properties that things have independently of the reactions of an observer. A moral property exists only if the observer has the appropriately favourable or unfavourable sentiment in response to it.³ This is what Hume means in claiming that we cannot find the virtue or vice until we find the relevant sentiment within our own breasts.
Though he rejects objectivism, he does not deny that moral judgments are about objective features of things. If I judge that this benevolent action is right, or that this murder is wrong, I rely on a judgment that this action is benevolent or that action is an unprovoked killing of an innocent victim. But though I make the judgment about the moral property on the basis of these judgments about objective properties of the action and the people involved, my judgment about the moral property does not regard it as an objective property.⁴ The moral property exists only if the observer has the relevant sort of response. 
- Hume does not mean that goodness or badness consists simply in the feeling of the observer. If he did mean this, his view would have absurd results; one might argue that if this is where the badness of murder is found, I acquire the badness of murder, and so become bad, simply by having a feeling of disapproval.⁵ Hume means that the badness of the murder consists in the deliberate killing of an innocent victim and the resulting disapproval by the observer; he does not mean that the badness would exist if the feeling of disapproval existed but no murder had been committed. 
- If Hume reaches an anti-objectivist conclusion, what is his conclusion about? Is it about the meaning of moral judgments, and hence about the metaphysical claims that they imply? Or is it about the nature of moral facts themselves? His claim that in making a moral judgment about an action we ‘mean’ only that we have a sentiment about it does not answer all our questions.⁶ For we might take the claim in at least three ways: 
    * Moral judgments are statements about the speaker’s feelings - The first view faces a simple objection. If you judge an action to be right, and I judge the same action to be wrong, but I mean that I disapprove of the action and you mean that you approve of it, my judgment that the action is wrong does not contradict your judgment that it is right. But in fact we think the two judgments are contradictory. This is a good reason for supposing that Hume has not given the right account of the meaning of a moral judgment.
Our view about when moral judgments contradict each other seems to presuppose that we take them to be judgments about ‘the objects themselves’, and not about our reactions. If the first interpretation of what we ‘mean’ is correct, he holds that it is essential to moral properties to be subjective. If the first interpretation is wrong, he may hold that neither subjectivity nor objectivity is essential to moral properties.
    * Moral judgments are not statements about feelings, but expressions of feelings. The second view of what we ‘mean’ in speaking of moral rightness makes moral judgments into expressions of sentiments, rather than statements about them. This is the non-cognitivist interpretation of Hume’s position. 
    * When we make moral judgments, we are only talking about (referring to) feelings. Error theory. These two interpretations of Hume’s claim about what we ‘mean’ both assume that he seeks to give an account of the meaning of moral terms. But the third interpretation is also worth considering, since it rejects that assumption. By ‘mean’ he may simply mean ‘refer to’ or ‘talk about’. In that case he does not consider the semantics of moral terms, but makes the ontological claim that all we are talking about is our reaction to the action that we say is morally good or bad. We do not identify any further objective property beyond its non-moral properties, because it has no objective moral properties. According to this view, objectivists may have grasped the meaning of moral judgments, but they are wrong about the objective existence of moral properties of things.
This ontological interpretation captures part of Hume’s position. Should it be preferred to the interpretation that also ascribes to him a claim about the meaning of moral judgments? We would have a good reason to prefer the third interpretation if we thought that Hume argues for a sceptical or nihilist conclusion about moral properties. According to this view, the meaning of our moral judgments implies that the objects themselves have moral properties, but, in Hume’s view, the implication is false.⁸ Objectivists are right about the meaning of moral judgments; hence they are right to say that moral properties, if they exist, are objective properties; but they are wrong to believe that there are any such properties. In Hume’s view, moral properties are essentially connected to motivation. His conviction is expressed in his internalism. It supports his denial of objectivism. If he had believed that moral properties are essentially both objective and motivational, his argument to show that these two features are incompatible would have shown that there are no moral properties.
But since he does not take objectivity to be essential to moral properties, he avoids scepticism and nihilism. Hume has a strong reason, therefore, not to hold an error theory. In rejecting rationalism and objectivism, he takes himself to reject the errors of philosophers, not the errors of ordinary moral agents and judges. He takes the presumed existence of moral goodness and badness to be part of ordinary life. His task is to find what moral goodness and badness consist in, not whether there are any such things
- Hume’s request to Hutcheson concerns the subjectivism and sentimentalism that Hutcheson also affirms. The same doctrine is relevant to Hume’s further remark that Hutcheson has given no sufficient reason for accepting naturalism rather than voluntarism about God and morality.¹⁶ Hutcheson rejects Balguy’s allegation that sentimentalism implies voluntarism, and so he defends an important element in Shaftesbury’s realism. In rejecting voluntarism he agrees with Butler. Hume, however, agrees with Balguy’s objection that Hutcheson cannot escape voluntarism about God and morality.¹⁷ Sentimentalism implies that moral properties exist only in relation to spectators with sentiments like ours. Hence they cannot, according to Hume, be assumed to exist in relation to God.¹⁸ Whether or not it is right for God to do anything depends on how God reacts to it. If God’s moral sense is different from ours, what is right for him is different from what is right for us. If he has no moral sense, nothing is right or wrong for him.¹⁹ Hume suggests that Hutcheson should discuss this issue more fully in print only if he thinks he can avoid the agnostic conclusion about God’s moral outlook. If, like Hume, he believes the agnostic conclusion is correct, his ‘character’ (i.e., reputation) and ‘situation’ (as a professor of moral philosophy expected to support Christian morality) make it unwise for him to publish his views.  
- Hutcheson might be expected to agree with all this, since he believes that God has benevolent sentiments and a moral sense. He believes that since we see that wise provision has been made for the needs of human beings in this world, and since such provision must proceed from a benevolent agent, we must attribute to God a moral sense that approves of this benevolence. Hume has reasons—developed in his critique of natural religion in the Dialogues—for objecting to the premisses of Hutcheson’s argument, but his objections do not seem to aim specifcially at the claim that God has a moral sense. They would apply equally to the claim that God is a rational being who is obliged by immutable moral principles. Hume has a reasonable point about Hutcheson’s position, but it is not exactly the one he emphasizes in his remarks about voluntarism. His reasonable point is that Hutcheson ought not to try to separate himself from theological voluntarists, and therefore ought to accept the arguments of rationalists who argue that his position agrees with the voluntarists in making morality mutable and dependent on God’s preferences. That is an unwelcome result for Hutcheson, but Hume argues that it follows from his rejection of objectivism and acceptance of sentimentalism.
- Balguy and Hutcheson believe that if sentimentalism is committed to voluntarism, we have reason to doubt sentimentalism. Hume answers that voluntarism is simply a consequence that we have to live with. 
- Though he does not pretend to satisfy an objectivist about moral properties, he qualifies his claims about the moral sense so that they allow him to accept, or at least to explain, some objectivist intuitions without drawing objectivist conclusions. 
- In Hume’s view, moral judgments are, or require, expressions of sentiment, and do not simply describe external facts. Since he has argued that his opponents do not give suffciient conditions for moral judgments, he needs to show that the addition of a sentiment allows him to give sufficient conditions. Not just any kind of sentiment will do. If we react to actions we believe to be wrong with a sentiment that rests on a belief that the actions are objectively wrong, the analysis of our moral sentiments suggests that we believe in objective wrongness. If this belief in objective wrongness is needed to distinguish moral sentiments from other favourable and unfavourable sentiments towards actions, Hume’s account of moral properties conflicts with the account that our moral sentiments favour. This result would not vindicate our moral sentiments, but it would show that they do not support Hume’s account of moral judgments.²⁴ Hume recognizes that an objection he has urged against the rationalists may be urged against his account of moral judgments and properties. He argued that all the relations taken to constitute eternal ftinesses could hold between non-rational creatures as well, so that these relations are insufficient for moral facts and properties. His opponent now suggests that all sorts of things, including actions of non-rational agents, might provoke the favourable sentiment that, according to Hume, is sufficient for moral right and wrong, and so this sentiment cannot give us sufficient conditions for moral rightness and wrongness (iii 1.2.4). We might try to defend Hume by replying that the sentiment appropriate to moral wrongness includes the belief that a rational agent has harmed the interests of others. If this belief—or a suitably refined statement of it—is essential to moral sentiment, the sentiments provoked by rocks falling on houses or young trees choking their parents are not moral sentiments. But this reply is not open to Hume. He denies that any belief about the objects of a sentiment is essential to the sentiment, since he holds that connexions between sentiments and beliefs are contingent.²⁵ The moral sentiment, then, must be distinguished from other passions by its character as a sensation, not by any connected beliefs. It is logically possible for the moral sentiment to be caused by actions of non-rational agents or movements of inanimate objects. Still, Hume does not believe his position is open to the objection that damages his opponents’ position. For he claims that the actions of rational agents produce a distinct sentiment; even though we feel favourable to the results of natural processes, to the behaviour of animals, and to actions of rational agents, the feeling is different in the different cases, just as both music and wine produce pleasures, but pleasures of recognizably different kinds. GivenHume’saccount oftheidentity andindividuationofpassions, thepleasuresfrom wine and from music must be different sensations, with different introspectible characters, one of which is always correlated only with wine and the other with music. Similarly, then, the contemplation of the actions of rational agents produces a phenomenally distinct feeling. This suggestion faces a difficulty. For contemplation of the actions of rational agents results in many different passions. There seems to be no one passion that results from contemplation, and it is not plausible to identify all the resulting passions with moral sentiment. On contemplating an action I might feel thwarted or jealous or disappointed, and so might be moved to act one way or the other on contemplation of an action or a person. Hume agrees that none of these reactions is a moral judgment. He does not tell us to expand our conception of moral judgment to embrace all these reactions. An account of the moral sentiment should identify a sentiment that we feel in the cases where we naturally judge that something is right or wrong. ‘Naturally’ has to be added here to take account of Hume’s objection to the divines. He does not follow their separation of genuine virtues from traits that we simply look on with favour. But he believes that, if we set aside the divines’ conception of morality, we can still identify a class of judgments against which we can test our account of a moral sentiment. He suggests, therefore, that we make moral judgments whenever we have a disinterested sentiment towards someone’s action.²⁶ A disinterested point of view cannot be part of the sentiment or essential to the sentiment, given Hume’s conditions for the identity of sentiments. Hume’s claim should be understood as an empirical prediction; if we contemplate human actions while turning our attention away from their effects on ourselves in particular, we have a phenomenally distinctive feeling. This effort of attention may be difficult, and so it may be difficult to recognize the distinctive feeling resulting from disinterested contemplation. But once we get used to the effort of attention, we recognize the distinctive feeling.²⁷ But this suggestion still seems to leave us with too many feelings, some of which do not seem to be the moral sentiment. The Emperor Heliogabalus is supposed to have killed Christians because he liked the combination of colours produced by red blood and green grass. If we had seen the results of one of these episodes and had admired the pleasing combination of colours, our reaction would have been quite disinterested, but it would not necessarily involve any moral appraisal at all. Hence, the point of view that causes the moral sentiment cannot be merely disinterested. 
- Hume answers this objection through a more careful description of the type of disinterested contemplation that he has in mind. He suggests that if we attend to the effects of actions on people’s interests, we are moved by ‘our sympathy with the interests of society’ (iii 3.1.12). When I see you being pleased, I imagine myself being pleased, and I actually feel some of the sort of pleasure that you feel. But Hume recognizes that this sort of sympathetic pleasure seems too variable to be identifeid with moral sentiment.²⁸ Though sympathy is directed to other people’s interest, it seems to vary in ways that are inappropriate for moral judgments, since they remain stable while sympathy varies. If A protects B against C’s aggression, we regard A’s action as right. Our sympathy matches the moral judgment if it is directed towards B and the benefit that B gains from A. But if we think, in the same disinterested way, about C, we sympathize with C’s frustration, and so we change our sympathy. But we do not conclude that A’s action is both right and wrong, or neither right nor wrong. We attend to B rather than C, and this attention aligns our sympathetic pleasure with the correct moral judgment. Why do we fxi our sympathy on the potential victim rather than on the potential aggressor? We might be inclined to answer that it is because we believe that what A is doing is right and what C is trying to do is wrong, so that we believe B deserves our sympathy and C does not. This answer is not open to Hume, since it makes our sentiments depend on moral beliefs in the way that he tries to avoid. And so he offers a different answer. He suggests that a purely egocentric point of view makes it difficult for us to make up our minds or to have any steady view of the action we consider, because we find that other people contradict our egocentric sentiment. We are most likely to form a sentiment that avoids contradiction if we adapt ourselves to the general attitude to a given situation. In the case we have mentioned, most people attend to the benefti B receives rather than to the harm that C receives, so that we will be least liable to be contradicted if we share the general attitude and sympathize with B rather than C.²⁹ Something similar is true in the case of sympathy. Hume suggests that we want some constant point of view, to save us the trouble of continually changing our view of the action in the face of different people’s egocentric views; these views present so many ‘contradictions’ to our own view that they loosen us ‘from our first station’ and leave us in a vacillating condition. But this suggestion is open to doubt; different people’s egocentric views do not contradict mine, if they simply report that the same action affects other people differently. Why should I not decide to stick to my initial egocentric point of view? If I tell you I am grateful to A because A did me a good turn, you can understand my sentiment, and we can successfully communicate with each other, even though you do not yourself feel grateful to A. If I approve of A because I recognize that A is useful to me and I sympathetically disapprove of A because A is dangerous to you, my reactions to A do not contradict each other, and neither makes the other less stable. Similarly, if (in the case described above) some people approve of A’s protecting B against aggression from C because they sympathize with B, while others disapprove of A’s frustrating C because they sympathize with C, their reactions are consistent, and we can share both reactions without any conflict or vacillation. These objections, however, may presuppose a non-Humean view of sentiments. If beliefs are internal to some sentiments, we can sometimes show that two sentiments are consistent because they rest on consistent beliefs. Hence ‘I take pleasure in x because x gives pleasure to B’ and ‘I find x painful because x causes pain to C’ are consistent, and we have no reason to expect that either will tend to displace the other. But Hume believes that the relation between a belief and a sentiment is always empirical and causal. The two sentiments we are to consider must be described independently of the beliefs we have mentioned, and hence we cannot rely on the beliefs to show that the sentiments are not contradictory. We must simply say that in these cases we fnid x both pleasant and painful. But if we offer Hume this reply, we face a further question. If we do not make beliefs internal to sentiments, what makes sentiments contradictory? Hume’s subjectivism about moral judgments makes it difficult to understand our assumption that if you say an action is right and I say it is wrong, we contradict each other. Since, in his view, you report your favourable sentiment and I report my unfavourable sentiment, neither of us contradicts the other. The same difficulty arises for his claim that sentiments contradict each other in a way that induces vacillation and so causes us to seek a steadier point of view. 
- Perhaps Hume could defend his main point by abandoning claims about contradiction. Perhaps he could claim instead that sympathy with B (the potential victim who is protected) and with C (the potential aggressor who is frustrated) are opposed, in that they tend to cancel or to weaken each other rather than to strengthen each other. Similarly, if something that I enjoy doing causes me to feel pride, the pride increases my pleasure, but if it causes me to feel shame, that reduces my pleasure. Perhaps the opposition that we fnid in these cases supports Hume’s argument about sympathy. This does not seem obvious, however. If we assume opposition rather than genuine contradiction, sympathy with B is opposed to sympathy with C no more than sympathy with B or C is opposed to pleasure caused by music; for this pleasure may also reduce my sympathy by distracting me. To avoid this sort of opposition, I need to attend to the music, or to B, or to C, to the exclusion of other things. I do not seem to need to take some different point of view that causes me to sympathize with B or to sympathize with C or to enjoy the music, to the exclusion of the other passions. But even if we agree with Hume’s claim that we need to resolve ‘contradictions’ in our sympathies by taking some more generally shared point of view, it is not clear that the sympathy we take from this point of view will be stable, or that it will match our moral judgments. To avoid contradictions, we might sensibly adopt the view of most people around us. But if these people are fickle, so that they incline to sympathize sometimes with B and sometimes with C, we will be no less inclined to shift in our sympathy, though they will not contradict us. If they shift in their sympathy, or if they are more inclined to sympathize with C (the potential aggressor) than with B (the potential victim), their sympathy does not match our moral judgments, and is still not moral sentiment. 
- This criticism leads us to consider a different conception of the ‘common point of view’ that Hume offers, especially in the Inquiry. He describes the moral point of view as one that we can all share, irrespective of our private interests; this is the point of view of humanity.³¹ Our moral judgments proceed from a sentiment that we all share, apart from our particular perspectives on actions, when we contemplate actions that affect human interests. In virtue of that sentiment, our moral evaluation expresses a common point of view.³² When we take this point of view, we favour actions that promote the public good.³³ It is a frequent and widespread, and hence natural (in a sense of ‘natural’ that Hume accepts) fact about human beings that they are susceptible to feelings that are favourable to the public good. These are the feelings that match moral judgments. The relevant ‘universal principle of the human frame’ is benevolence, giving us ‘a cool preference of what is useful and serviceable to mankind’
- Hume’s most plausible account of the moral sentiment is therefore this: 
    1) When we think impartially about the interests of those affected by an action, we form a distinctive sentiment about it. In the first claim Hume describes a common point of view that expresses community and solidarity with other human people. This point of view involves the impartial consideration of the effects of actions on people’s interests. We should be able to take this point of view without thinking about fairness, since Hume is trying to find the origin of moral sentiments without presupposing them. The common point of view on a theft, for instance, will recognize the pain suffered by the victim and the thief and by anyone else affected, but will leave out the fact that I or my friend or my enemy is the thief or the victim, or the beneficiary of the theft. What sentiment do we form from this impartial point of view? It is difficult to see how we can be expected to agree on any one reaction. Perhaps I am more inclined to sympathize with the frustration, or greed, or whatever other motive might lead to theft, and you are more inclined to sympathize with the victim’s feelings of loss. Apart from these difference in inclinations, we might have different views about how bad it is for people to lose what they have, compared with failing to get what they want. The fact that each of us takes an impartial point of view does not ensure agreement in our reactions, since we may have different inclinations and non-moral beliefs that affect our reactions. But perhaps Hume wants us to abstract from these individual differences and to focus exclusively on the pain and pleasure of the thief and the victim. In that case, our reaction depends on whether the pain of the victim is greater than the pleasure of the thief, or the reverse. Perhaps this is why he identifies the common point of view with benevolence, understood as concern for the public good. This seems to be an empirical claim, about the result of taking the common point of view, rather than a description of what constitutes taking the common point of view. But if Hume intends the common point of view to abstract from everything except pleasure and pain, it is close to benevolence, as a hedonist utilitarian understands it.³⁴ 
    2) This sentiment is benevolence, favouring the public good. By introducing benevolence into his account of the moral sense Hume agrees with Hutcheson, but he simplifies Hutcheson’s view. Hutcheson confines the moral sense to the moral judge who reacts favourably to the benevolence of an agent; he makes a second-order attitude of approval or endorsement of a sentiment essential to the moral sense. Simple benevolence without this further approval does not involve the moral sense, according to Hutcheson. The further approval is Hutcheson’s analogue to the operation of conscience, as Butler conceives it.³⁵ According to Hume, however, in the passage we have just discussed, the moral sense does not require this second-order element. A benevolent reaction by itself constitutes an expression of the moral sense. Our moral judgment is either this benevolent reaction itself (if Hume is a non-cognitivist) or a report of it (if he is a subjectivist). 
    3) This sentiment is the moral sentiment; the actions it favours are those we intuitively judge to be right. 
    
    These are all empirical claims. The first asserts that attention to certain features of an action tends to cause a sentiment. The second asserts that this sentiment tends to cause certain kinds of actions. The third asserts that the sentiment causing these actions is the one we feel when we make moral judgments. 
- Has Hume found the moral sentiment? We may well doubt whether he has identified just one introspectibly distinct feeling for all and only the actions we regard as morally good. In some cases our reaction of moral approval might be enthusiastic, if the morally good coincides with our interest, or the agent is a friend of ours; in other cases it might be grudging, if the agent is an enemy or if the action harms us; in others it might be entirely neutral, if our interests and affections are quite uninvolved. Hume admits that the moral sentiment may co-exist with others, but he maintains that with practice we can distinguish it. But even if we agree with him on this point, we may doubt his assumption that it has a distinct introspectible quality that is present on all occasions. It does not seem obvious that an introspectible quality is the common feature of the moral sentiment on all the occasions when it occurs with different tones. All the different reactions—eager, grudging, neutral—express the sentiment of disinterested approval, but not because they all contain the same phenomenally distinctive sensation. They share a certain kind of evaluative belief (or a disjunction of appropriate beliefs); but Hume’s theory does not allow a doxastic element to individuate sentiments.³⁶ 
- Would Hume do better, then, to abandon his non-doxastic conception of sentiments? If he abandoned it, he would also have to give up some other views that matter to him. If he agreed that beliefs are essential to some sentiments, he would undermine his criticism of the divines, who want to restrict moral goodness and badness to voluntary actions and states. Hume argues against the divines by claiming that we have the same sentiments both towards voluntary and towards non-voluntary states. In this argument he seems to assume that the belief that a state is voluntary cannot be essential to the identity of a sentiment. But this assumption conflicts with the claim that the moral sentiment requires some belief. 
- Moreover, if Hume were to concede that some evaluative beliefs are essential to moral sentiments, he would leave room for a rationalist reply to his sentimentalism. If the moral sentiment essentially involves evaluative beliefs, why should we not identify moral judgments with these beliefs, and moral properties with the properties that are mentioned in these beliefs? In that case, Hume’s attempted alternative to objectivism would apparently presuppose an objectivist account of the beliefs that partly constitute moral sentiment. He avoids this objection if he affirms that moral sentiment consists simply in a feeling with a distinctive phenomenal character; beliefs cause this feeling, but they are not essential to it. These beliefs, then, are not moral judgments, and the properties they mention are not moral properties, because their relation to moral sentiment is only causal. According to this view, if we judge that an action promotes the public good, but we are not at all moved to favour the action, we have not made a moral judgment, since moral judgment requires motivation. But though we might expect Hume to say this, he does not say it. For, in his view, I may learn to judge that something is good from the moral point of view, without the appropriate sentiment. In my moral judgment I say what someone would say who was directly affected by the action, I may not have the same feeling. Even if I have some feeling, I may not have equally strong feelings towards two actions that I judge to be equally wrong. My moral judgment, therefore, is neither the feeling nor a report on it.³⁷ Our appeals to a general point of view do not automatically change our passions, ‘nor do our passions often correspond entirely to the present theory’ (T iii 3.1.18). A may agree that B’s opposition to A’s plans is morally blameless, but may still be angry at B for this opposition.³⁸ Though reason may favour impartiality, our passions do not always go along with it. Hume explains his mention of reason by arguing the so-called reason opposing our passions is really another passion, ‘a general calm determination of the passions, founded on some distant view or reflexion’ (iii 3.1.18). In referring to a distant view, Hume relies on the assumption about calm passion that he uses to explain prudence.³⁹ When we take a ‘distant’ view, looking at a situation without reference to our own interest, our calm passions are excited. When we take a ‘closer’ view, and recognize how our interest is involved, more violent passions are aroused, and so our stronger feelings do not agree with our original calm passion. Hume might reasonably conclude, therefore, that moral judgments express or report the calm passion that is excited by sympathetic consideration of the interests of the people affected. But this is not his conclusion. He does not say that if we judge that A and B are equally blameworthy, we express an equally strong calm passion towards A and B. Instead he takes our judgment to predict what would be felt in certain circumstances.⁴⁰ He therefore seems to abandon his sentimentalism. For he no longer seeks to correlate the stable moral judgment with a stable actual sentiment; the stable judgment is a prediction, not a report, about sentiments. Some moral judgments, therefore, neither express nor report anyone’s occurrent sentiment. They are still about sentiments, since they are predictions about sentiments rather than judgments about objective properties of actions and people. But, as we saw in discussing ‘is’ and ‘ought’, Hume counts judgments about other people’s subjective states as judgments about what is ‘in the object’, and therefore as ‘is’ judgments. His present account of moral judgment seems to imply that moral properties are in the object, and that we can derive ‘ought’ from ‘is’. 
- If moral judgments are predictions about sentiments, Hume’s analysis does not support his claim that when you pronounce the action vicious ‘you mean nothing but that . . . you have a feeling or sentiment of blame . . .’ (iii 1.1.26). Nor does it fit his internalist claim that moral judgments necessarily motivate the subject who makes them. His predictive analysis implies that his internalist and subjectivist account of moral judgment and moral properties is mistaken.⁴¹ Hume’s account of the causes of moral sentiment even suggests that one might defend a more strongly objectivist account of moral judgments than the one he allows. In his view, the sentiment is aroused by the belief that a particular action is (for example) benefciial to those affected by it. Why should we not take this belief to be sufficient for a moral judgment? Hume’s account of the content of the moral judgment seems to show how easily we can separate the making of the judgment itself from the attitude that it arouses in the judge. It is easy, on this view, to see why moral judgments are regularly connected with action; they characteristically express the point of view of humanity and appeal to our benevolent sentiments. Once we see this, we may doubt whether moral judgments motivate all by themselves, and therefore cannot be derived from reason. For not everyone has benevolent sentiments to an equal degree, and on some occasions some people may have no benevolent sentiments. But they may still believe that this action promotes the public good, and therefore appeals to a benevolent person. Hume seems to have found objective properties that could be identifeid with moral goodness and badness. And so he seems to have undermined his efforts to show that moral distinctions are not founded in reason. 
- Hume rejects an objectivist account on the ground that it omits the internal connexion between moral judgment and motivation. But his counterfactual analysis referring to sentiments also omits that internal connexion. Once he has abandoned internalism, it is not clear why we should treat moral judgments as judgments about counterfactual sympathy rather than judgments directly about the properties of actions and people that tend to arouse the counterfactual sympathy. 
- If, therefore, we examine these details of Hume’s account of moral judgment, we reach a different conclusion from the one we reach if we confine ourselves to the practical and metaphysical arguments and to the discussion of ‘is’ and ‘ought’. These initial arguments support his internalism, subjectivism, and sentimentalism. But his account of the moral sentiment, and his substitution of counterfactual for actual sentiment, undermine his case against objectivism. He does not notice this, because he still maintains that moral judgments are about sentiments; he may suppose that this feature of moral judgments satisfies his internalist constraint. 
- If one believes that Hume’s internalism and subjectivism are the most important and valuable aspects of his theory, one might restore consistency to his position by using a device favoured by later non-cognitivists. In cases where Hume admits that we make moral judgments without the appropriate sentiment, we might say that the moral terms in these judgments do not have their normal sense, but we use them in a ‘non-standard’ or ‘inverted commas’ sense. This resort to differences of sense would avoid the inconsistency that Hume introduces into his position. Hume might welcome this way to restore consistency, if he had noticed his inconsistency. But this move is costly; for it does not seem obvious that motivational and non-motivational uses of moral terms involve different senses.
- Butinanycase,anon-cognitivist’sappealtodifferentsenses,whetherplausibleorimplausible, may not be the best way to restore consistency to Hume’s position. One might be more inclined to emphasize the objectivist elements. Though internalism and subjectivism are prominent in his critical arguments and in his presentation of his own view, something worth considering survives the rejection of these claims. His suggestion that a moral judgment is one ‘in which he expects all his audience are to concur with him’ (I 9.6) correctly implies that moral considerations express a more common point of view than that of one person’s interest. What sorts of considerations are recognized from this common point of view?:
    - Hume’s account ofhowweequally blametwo actionsthatexcitedifferent sentimentsimpliesthat our judgment is a counterfactual judgment about how certain sorts of observers would react. If he offers this as a general account of moral judgments, the subject-matter of moral judgments is the sentiment of the observer taking the common point of view. According to the first view, moral goodness and badness would change if observers taking the common point of view no longer favoured the public good. Whether this is possible or not depends on how the common point of view is to be defined. Is it no longer the common point of view if it ceases to be concerned with the public good? Alternatively, if everyone were to become indifferent to the public good, and were to agree in a general indifference to this aspect of actions, would the same common point of view now approve of something different? 
    - Alternatively, we might concentrate on Hume’s remarks about the actions that such an observer favours—those that promote the public good. These remarks might suggest that the subject matter of moral judgments is the public good. Ineithercase,Hume’sviewwouldbeobjectivist,insofarasitwouldmakemoraljudgments true independently of the reactions of a particular moral judge.⁴² In the second case, his view would be more strongly objectivist, since it would make them true independently of the reactions of any judge or observer.
- Our discussion of the position that Hume opposes to the ‘vulgar systems of morality’ has given us reason to believe that his conception of moral judgment is inconsistent.⁴³ Three different revisions of Hume leave us with some plausible and influential views: (1) If we take internalism to be most important, we will accept non-cognitivism, as later emotivists and prescriptivists do, sometimes for reasons that they take to be Hume’s reasons.⁴⁴ (2) If we take Hume to be a subjectivist, we will take moral judgments to describe the sentiments of the spectator or of some class of actual, potential, or ideal spectators. This is the basis of Smith’s account of moral judgments as statements about the impartial observer. (3) If we take Hume to oppose theories that separate moral goodness from empirical human feelings, we may take the objectivist utilitarian strand in his discussion to be the one that deserves defence and expansion; that is why Sidgwick treats Hume as a source for his utilitarianism.⁴⁵ The utilitarian is right to emphasize Hume’s assumption that the common point of view is a utilitarian point of view aiming at the public good. But one might be doubtful about Hume’s reasons for believing that the common point of view underlying morality is utilitarian. Might one argue that the point of view of humanity is non-utilitarian? This issue is especially relevant when we consider Hume’s views about the utilitarian and non-utilitarian elements in different aspects of morality. 
- He divides the virtues into natural and artificial, on the basis of his general claim that we value virtuous actions only insofar as they express a virtuous character (T iii 2.1.2; iii 3.1.4). If we commend a particular action, it must be because we approve the state of character that it proceeds from, and this state of character must immediately appeal to our sympathetic feelings (those that belong to the principle of humanity) (iii 2.1.6). What state of character, then, appeals immediately to our sympathetic feelings? Hume believes we cannot answer this question by saying that the virtuous state of character is the one that values virtuous actions precisely because they are virtuous or morally good; for he has already claimed that we value virtuous action only as expressions of a virtuous character. Hence the virtuous person who (supposedly) values virtuous actions simply because they are virtuous must in fact value them because they are signs of virtuous character. But we still do not know why she values virtuous character. If we say that she values it because of the virtuous actions it produces, we proceed in a circle. Hume offers a way out of this circle of explanation, by introducing a non-moral motive. The virtuous agent must have some motive for doing the virtuous action, apart from the sense of its morality (its moral rightness or goodness); and the tendency to do this kind of action must appeal to morally enlightened judges apart from their sense of its morality.¹ If the agent and the judges could not be moved by these non-moral sentiments, we could not understand either the agent’s motive or the judges’ grounds for approval.² 
- Different virtues, however, arouse our non-moral sentiments in different ways. The differences mark a division between:
    - Natural virtues including benevolence. My act of benevolence belongs to a natural virtue because of three features: 
        - My action tends to benefit others. 
        - I act out of a desire to benefit others. 
        - My motive arouses approval in an impartial and sympathetic observer. Both my desire to help and the observer’s reaction of approval are natural reactions to this action; for we have a natural sentiment of benevolence that explains both my desire and the observer’s reaction. In this case we face no difficulty in saying what it is about benevolent action that appeals to us as agents and observers. 
    - Artificial virtues, including justice. An act of justice, however, has neither of the first two features. It has the third feature; but this must be explained differently. A simple appeal to benevolence cannot explain our attachment to justice.³ 
- HumetriestoresolvetwodifficultiesarisingfromHutcheson’saccountofjustice:(1) Thefirst objection concerns Hutcheson’s sentimentalism. Hutcheson rejects Hobbes’s self-interested and instrumental explanation of justice, and claims instead that justice appeals to our sentiment of benevolence, which the moral sense approves of. But it is diffciult to believe his claim that benevolence, understood as a sentiment involving an immediate reaction to actions and people, could support a utilitarian conception of justice that often acts against the interest of particular people who might be expected to arouse our benevolent sentiment. (2) But even if we could connect benevolence with utility, we would not have vindicated a utilitarian conception of justice. For we recognize just actions that do not promote utility. These two difficulties in Hutcheson’s position provoke two rationalist replies: (1) Balguy and Butler propose an alternative basis for benevolence. They introduce a rational principle of benevolence, and they rely on this principle, not on the sentiment of benevolence, to support moral principles that aim at the public good. (2) But even this rational principle of benevolence does not cover the whole of morality, and in particular does not cover justice. Principles of justice rest on a basis that is distinct from concern for the public good, and therefore cannot be explained by a utilitarian principle. 
- Hume sees the same difficulties in Hutcheson’s position, but he offers an anti-rationalist solution.⁴ In his view, benevolence cannot be the source of the just person’s motive or of the observer’s reaction; for this particular just action does not contribute to the good of others in the ways that provoke the sentiment of benevolence. Benevolence and humanity, in Hume’s view, would often lead us both to do and to approve unjust action.⁵ To see how concern for the public good could support justice, we have to look at the larger system of which particular just actions are a part, and we have to see that the system promotes the public good. 
- In the Treatise his argument about justice assumes that we are not concerned for the public interest as such (iii 2.1.11), but only for the interests of individual people, because of the effects of sympathy. Even if every particular just action promoted the public interest, this would not explain our favourable attitude towards it, since we have no favourable sentiment towards the public interest. In the Inquiry Hume drops his objection about concern for the public interest; the point of view of humanity that produces the moral sentiment involves concern for the good of society, not just the good of this or that individual.⁶ 
- But the acknowledgment of this concern for the public interest does not undermine Hume’s main reason for counting justice as an artificial virtue. He argues that particular just actions do not seem to make any intelligible appeal to our concern for the public interest; for this concern would apparently often lead us to prefer the confiscation of a rich miser’s property to benefit the poor, whereas justice requires us to respect the miser’s right to his property. Here Hume recognizes the second rationalist objection to Hutcheson, but he does not agree with the rationalists in turning to a non-utilitarian conception of justice. He seeks to resolve the objection by showing how our concern for the public interest becomes attached to just actions that initially appear to conflict with the public interest. 
- According to the argument against Hutcheson, we cannot explain how our concern for the public interest, all by itself, could move us to take an interest in just actions. Hume argues that we need a two-stage account to resolve this difficulty for a utilitarian view. The first stage identifies our original motive for establishing justice. Here Hume gives a Hobbesian answer, referring to self-interest. The second stage explains our moral admiration for the rules of justice, once they have been established; at this stage Hume gives a non-Hobbesian answer, referring to concern for the public interest.
- Hume rejects an initially plausible account of the origin of justice that might be ascribed to Hobbes. The observance of principles of justice results from our acting on the law of nature that enjoins the pursuit of peace and non-aggression. Hence we might trace the origin of justice to a promise—a Hobbesian ‘covenant’—to refrain from aggression. Hume, however, believes that no appeal to a promise explains the observance of justice. A promise establishes a practice of mutual non-aggression only if we already recognize an obligation to keep the promise; but both the obligation to keep a promise and the recognition of this obligation⁸ depend on an antecedent practice or ‘convention’ of non-aggression. Since the obligation to keep a promise presupposes the convention of non-aggression, it cannot explain the convention.⁹ We might take Hume to mean that we cannot found the moral obligations connected with justice in a promise, because the promise will be irrelevant unless we already recognize an obligation of justice to keep promises. This would be a reasonable point, but it would not be relevant to Hobbes’s appeal to a covenant. Hobbes takes the relevant obligation to be prudential; he might argue that prudential obligation is the basis of the obligation to keep a promise, which then introduces moral obligation.¹⁰ Such an argument does not require antecedent recognition of a moral obligation to keep a promise. But Hume’s point bears more directly on Hobbes’s appeal to self-interest as the basis of a covenant. I will recognize a prudential obligation to keep a promise to you only if I take it to be in my interest. But I will believe it is in my interest to keep a promise to you only if I already have some reason to believe that you will also keep your promise to me. But how can I form such a belief if I have no previous experience of your keeping promises? Hume answers that we need an antecedent practice or convention of non-aggression that gives me reason to rely on you. Two people may form such a convention to do their parts in rowing a boat, if the boat needs two people to row it, each of them wants to go to the same place, and neither sees a better way to get there. This convention may precede any promise, because we can establish a convention without having made any promise. We simply need to be aware of the mutual advantage that depends on co-ordinated action.¹¹ By seeing this advantage and acting on it, we establish a convention of mutually benefciial, co-ordinated action that requires no initial promise.¹² Rules about non-aggression, the use of language, and the use of money arise from convention in the same way. In all these cases the prudent action for each party individually depends on what the other party does, so that the conduct of the two (or more) parties is inter-dependent. Each of them gets the expected benefit only if both play their part. In these circumstances a mutually beneficial convention develops. Self-interest, therefore, provides a reason and motive for observing these conventions, even though they may appear to frustrate self-interest. Our desire for possession, for instance, encourages us to grab other people’s possessions, but we notice that we would frustrate our desire for possession if we were to indulge it by always grabbing what we can grab from other people, and thereby encouraging them to do the same to us. Hence the desire for possessions also gives us the motive to regulate it.¹³ We do not need to introduce any specifically moral concern into the motives of people who establish a system of justice. Hence we have found a motive to produce just actions, ‘distinct from their morality’, as Hume requires.¹⁴  Hume is clearer than Hobbes about the distinct contributions of human nature and external circumstances to the conditions favourable for justice. He notices that complete selfishness is not necessary. He only assumes confined generosity; and he remarks that this would not result in aggression and conflict if we did not have to compete for scarce resources (iii 2.2.5–7). To form the state, we need no formal agreement to lay down our arms; and we need not explain how we can recognize an obligation to keep such an agreement. An appeal to convention explains how the appropriate practices can get started without any prior agreement. But even if some practices satisfy Hume’s conditions for conventions, and grow up without explicit agreements or moral sanctions, this pattern does not seem to fit most actual systems of justice. For these systems involve many individuals in complex interactions; the penalties of cheating may not be immediate and obvious, as they are in the case of the two rowers who can move the boat only by their joint efforts, and cheating may often offer me apparent beneftis. 
- The apparent beneftis of cheating raise diffciulties for Hume and for Hobbes at some of the same points. Before an effective system is established, it is difficult to see how any agreement to ‘lay down our arms’ could be stable, since any given individual beneftis if others lay down their arms and he does not. This is true no less of Humean conventions. Moreover, once a system of justice is working, Hobbes’s dispute with the fool raises a more serious question about cheats and free-riders. Even if the existence and general observance of rules of justice benefits me, not every action falling under the rules benefits me. Why, then, should I refrain from cheating when I get the appropriate opportunity? Theanswertothisquestion,inHume’sview,explainstheoriginofgovernment.Following one line of thought in Hobbes, he traces the necessity for government to our tendency to act on our short-sighted passions.¹⁶ The remedy for the effect of these passions is foresight and the calm passions it provokes. I can see that the long-term benefit to me of a stable system of non-aggression will be greater than the short-term benefit I will gain by cheating. When the opportunity for cheating is imminent, it will excite a violent passion that will be stronger than the calm passion favouring my long-term interest. But before the opportunity is imminent, my calm passion is stronger, and I can act on it by denying myself the opportunity to act on the violent passion that I know will be aroused. This is why Ulysses had himself tied to the mast, or I might pour the whiskey down the sink if I know I will want too much of it. The establishment of governments is a pre-emptive action against violent passions. Humeseemstobelievethatpre-emptionanswersthechallengepresentedbythefree-rider, by distinguishing the short-term from the long-term attitude to the rules and institutions of justice (iii 2.2.24). If free-riders steadily took the long-term view, they would see that they benefit from accepting and observing the rules of a system of justice, and they would take pre-emptive action against themselves. To see whether this is a good answer to the free-rider, we need to separate two claims: 
    - I am better off in the long term if I live under a system of justice that imposes these specific rules on me than I would be if I did not live under such a system. Hume has a good defence of the first claim, and so a good argument for pre-emptive action.
    - I am never better off in the long term if I break one of these specific rules. But a defence of the second claim is needed to answer the free-rider, if an answer must appeal only to Hobbesian motives. We might come closer to answering the free-rider if we could find an indirect egoist defence of a system that excludes egoistic calculation.¹⁷ We are all better off in certain respects if we habitually follow rules of justice without asking about our interest. A system in which people do not ask this question is more stable, and—in that respect—everyone benefits from it more than they would from a system in which they are always asking about their interest. In the latter system, people may calculate, falsely or truly, that violation of the rules is beneficial to them individually; if their calculations lead them to break the rules, the system will be less stable than the one that excludes egoistic calculation. This indirect egoist argument against calculation of self-interest is different from the one that Hume offers. Hume suggests that if I calculate my long-term interest correctly, I will see that it is in my interest to observe rules of justice. Indirect egoists, however, concede that sometimes a true calculation of my long-term interest favours a violation of the rules of justice, but then they argue that we are better off if we avoid this sort of calculation and observe rules of justice. This argument takes Hume’s argument a step further. But the indirect egoist argument does not offer Hume a good answer; it seems to share the basic limitation of his argument. If we grant that rigid observance of rules of justice makes us all better off than we would all be if each of us looked out for her own advantage, it does not follow that I always do better for myself if I form the habit of rigidly following rules of justice even when I would benefti more by cheating. In some conditions I might do better for myself if I were less rigid than other people in adhering to rules of justice. As the indirect egoist claims, I am better off if people in general are not prone to act on self-interested calculations; but if I am a free-rider, I ask why I should always observe the rules of the system that beneftis everyone. An appeal to the beneftis of the system for everyone does not answer this question.¹⁸ We may reasonably doubt, therefore, whether Hume’s account of the origin of justice completely succeeds. His illuminating discussion of convention and of foresight suggests how a basically Hobbesian account might be made more plausible. But the improvements to Hobbes do not remove the basic difficulties that arise for attempts to find conclusive non-moral reasons for upholding a system of justice. But even if these doubts are justified, they may not matter much to Hume’s overall argument about justice. For, incontrast toHobbes, hebelievesthat ourapproval ofjusticerestsnot only on self-interest, but also on a moral sentiment. We approve of justice because of sympathy developed by artifcie. Once we have set up a system that beneftis everyone, sympathy causes us to respond to the benefits and harms to others and to the public, not merely to ourselves, that result from the observance and violation of rules of justice (iii 2.2.24). This sympathy is a natural reaction to the effects of the rules, though it is strengthened by deliberate artifcie and training. Hume has explained why the actions required by a system of justice do not appeal in their own right to our moral sense, since they do not individually promote the good of particular people or the public good. But once a system of justice is working, we see that we benefti by its presence and would be harmed by its absence, and we see that the same is true of everyone. And so our sympathetic feeling is engaged by the system of justice, and attached derivatively to particular just actions and rules
- In the Inquiry Hume recognizes a sentiment that is concerned directly with the public good. This is the sentiment engaged by a working system of justice. He appeals to this sentiment to explain ‘why utility pleases’.¹⁹ In opposition to Hobbes, and in agreement with Hutcheson, he maintains that this concern for the public interest is distinct from our concern for our own interest. Both concerns engage us when we approve of justice. According to Hume, we regard justice as a moral virtue because it engages our other-regarding sentiment, which he calls sometimes ‘benevolence’ and sometimes ‘humanity’. 
- In the light of his argument, what should we say about Hume’s initial objection to the claim (accepted by Hutcheson) that benevolence is the basis of our approval of just actions? Earlier, he observed that our benevolence might be engaged by the prospect of distributing the rich miser’s possessions rather than by observing the rules of private property. But now he suggests that reflexion on the benefits of the system of justice engages our benevolence on the side of observance of the rules of justice. Should we suppose, then, that our benevolence is engaged on both sides, since we see some benefit to others from redistribution and from the rules of property? Hume does not suggest this answer; he seems to assume that benevolence will be engaged on the side of upholding the rules of property. When we think about all the benefits resulting from the system of justice, we see that we need to uphold its rules, and so our benevolence supports the maintenance of rights of property. If benevolence responds to these considerations, it must be a utilitarian attitude. But in that case it is puzzling that Hume initially claimed that benevolence would support redistribution rather than the rules of property. 
- Perhaps Hume’s different claims about benevolence are more easily understood by appeal to indirect utilitarianism. He is less clear than Hutcheson about the distinctive character of indirect utilitarianism,²⁰ but closer attention to it might help his argument in some places. He suggests quite plausibly that if we look at a just action outside any system of justice, it will often seem contrary to the public interest. But a working system of justice changes things in two ways (The difference between the two forms of utilitarian argument is parallel to the difference between the two forms of egoist argument that might connect self-interest with a system of justice): 
    - Within a system of justice (say, a system of rules of property), the particular action that otherwise would not be in the public interest is in the public interest. Some cases seem to satisfy the second condition, but not the first. Stealing this loaf of bread here and now might be undetected, set no precedent, etc. Or telling this lie now might have no bad effects and many good ones. Such actions do not tend to undermine the general observance of the rule that prohibits lying and stealing. In these cases it might be better, given the particular situation, to violate the rule of justice. But it might be even better to have a system that prohibits violations in particular cases even when violations would be in the public interest. It is better if witnesses have the habit of telling the truth when they are questioned in court, or if lawyers try to make the best case for their clients, or if doctors focus on the health of their patients rather than on their social usefulness. If we are utilitarians, and we see the difference between these two cases, we will defend a system of justice by an indirect utilitarian argument. We saw that Hume seems to confine himself to the first sort of egoist argument, and does not seem to consider indirect egoism. Similarly, he usually connects justice and utility by a direct argument, arguing that a system of justice makes a particular action promote the public interest. 
    - Within a system of justice, it promotes the public interest to obey its rules whether or not obedience to them is in the public interest in particular cases. But he sometimes recognizes that the good consequences do not belong to particular actions but to the system of justice that requires these particular actions even when they have bad consequences.²¹ Hence he sometimes accepts an indirect utilitarian account of justice, without sharply distinguishing it from a direct utilitarian account. According to the indirect account, our moral sentiment responds secondarily to a particular just action (whether or not it promotes the public interest in the long run) because it responds primarily to the beneficial tendency of the system that enjoins just actions.

- But Martineau and Hume over-estimate the degree to which Hutcheson agrees with Butler. Though he goes some way towards acceptance of Butler’s view of conscience, he stops short on one crucial point. In Butler’s view, superior principles essentially appeal to authority rather than mere strength. If conscience is supreme, it is also most authoritative.
If it has authority to decide the questions it decides, it appeals to considerations that take legitimate precedence over the considerations that lower principles appeal to. One might infer that a supreme principle, so understood, must be a rational principle. But Hutcheson rejects that inference. He does not treat the moral sense as rational.
- we might well suppose that epistemological and metaphysical arguments spread sceptical doubt to experimental science. For experimental science deals with causal relations, relies on induction, and examines relations between external objects and human minds. Why should we not doubt its possibility if we accept Hume’s sceptical doubts about causation and so on? We might answer that experimental science does not concern itself with the causal connexions that are open to sceptical doubt. Even if this answer preserved experimental science from doubts about causation, it would be difficult to defend an analogous answer about induction and the external world. But in any case Hume does not offer this answer even about causation; for he agrees that the search for objective causal connexions is inseparable from empirical inquiry.¹⁰ He cannot, then, claim that his sceptical doubts do not apply to experimental science.
To reconcile experimental science with scepticism, he claims that we can concede the cogency of the sceptical argument without doing anything about it. Even if we admit that, strictly speaking, the science of human nature is based on illusions and errors, we do not worry about this sceptical conclusion when we are engaged in our experimental science. But if this is Hume’s view, the post-sceptical experimental science is not exactly the same as the pre-sceptical science that we relied on to support sceptical doubts. For in our pre-sceptical phase we do not admit that, strictly speaking, our experimental science is based on illusions, whereas we admit just this about our post-sceptical experimental science. The pre-sceptical science claims to reach justified conclusions about the real world, whereas the post-sceptical science makes no such claims.
Perhaps Hume might reject these claims about pre-sceptical and post-sceptical exper-imental science. He might say that the experimental science is just the same whether or not we are sceptics; our pre-sceptical and post-sceptical phases affect our epistemo-logical attitude to experimental science, not the outlook of experimental science itself.
But it is difficult to defend this division between the science and our epistemological attitude to it. Our experience, as we understand it, of boiling kettles and bare hands placed on them convinces us of claims, based on experience, about the causal rela-tions between boiling kettles and burnt hands. We cannot separate conviction on the basis of experience, taken to be of objects and causal relations, from common-sense beliefs or experimental science. A post-sceptical science needs to replace these beliefs with an outlook that persists after sceptical scrutiny; this outlook does not include conviction on the basis of evidence taken to support the conviction. The scope of Hume’s scepticism prevents him from separating experimental science from sceptical attitudes. 
- If common-sense views about morality commit us to claims about objectivity that Hume refutes, we have no reason to believe that anything is right or wrong. What difference might this make? Hume believes that the sceptical argument about secondary qualities makes no practical difference.¹¹ But his account of the impact of scepticism does not fit this judgment. 
- Hume does not believe that scepticism undermines ordinary moral convictions; for he believes, contrary to Balguy, that ordinary convictions do not include the beliefs that are undermined by his sceptical arguments against other philosophers. Changes in beliefs about the status of moral beliefs do not, in Hume’s view, affect moral beliefs or their practical significance. But if he is wrong on this point, his sceptical arguments may damage morality more than he recognizes. Such damage would be unwelcome to Hume, since he takes himself to be explaining and supporting moral convictions by revealing their true principles. 
- In a letter that describes his early philosophical development, Hume criticizes the ancient moralists for inattention to human nature. He claims that their views on virtue and happiness rest on groundless assumptions and prejudices, rather than on acquaintance with the relevant experimental details. He proposes, therefore, to pursue the study of human nature with the aim of deriving the whole of moral philosophy from it.¹³ What specific cases might support Hume’s claim that the ancients do not attend to human nature? Perhaps he means that, for instance, the Stoics would not have identified virtue with happiness if they had known more about human psychology.¹⁴ Because of their claims about virtue and happiness, they demand a humanly impossible degree of detachment from external goods. Even if some detachment is possible, perhaps it does more harm than good, by weakening morally desirable impulses as well.¹⁵ But even if this is a defensible criticism of the Stoics, it does not support Hume’s general verdict on the ancients. For some ancient critics attack the Stoics for their inattention to human nature.¹⁶ Hence these critics agree with Hume on the relevance of human nature. Moreover, the Stoics themselves have quite a lot to say about human nature, the passions, and human action. They do not agree with Hume on these topics, but they attend to facts about human nature. Chrysippus, Seneca, and Epictetus study our natural reactions to recognized goods and evils, in order to argue that we need different reactions that bring us closer to living a life that accords with nature. Both the Stoics and their critics attend to human nature, though they have different accounts of what nature requires. Hume might answer that simply talking of what one conceives as ‘human nature’ is not the attention to human nature that he recommends. Some Greek claims about human nature are not purely predictive, non-normative claims about human constitution or behaviour, but include a normative component. Butler recognizes this feature of ancient conceptions of nature in his own third sense of ‘nature’, which refers to the requirements of a system as a whole. As Butler says, this third sense tells us what the Stoics have in mind in claiming that virtue consists in living in accord with nature.
Hume’s division between the ‘experimental’ and the ‘hypothetical’ outlook applies to the normative conceptions of nature that we find in ancient moral philosophy in mind; his attack on the ancients applies no less to Butler.¹⁷ If this is at least part of what Hume means in claiming that ancient moral philosophy is ‘hypothetical’, he is right about the difference between himself and the ancients.
- Some of the ancients are right, in Hume’s view, about the nature and extent of the virtues.²⁰ He is a ‘great admirer’ of Cicero; he relies on Cicero’s catalogue of virtues, even though he believes that the Stoic moral theory from which Cicero derives his catalogue is hopelessly hypothetical. Perhaps he believes that Cicero’s catalogue does not really depend on Stoic moral theory. But if Cicero has a correct catalogue of the virtues, and if such a catalogue depends on accurate experimental science of human nature, how can ancient moralists fail to regard human nature? 
- Hume’s reasons for taking the ancients to be implicit anti-rationalists are as unconvincing as Hutcheson’s reasons for taking them to be explicit anti-rationalists. One might identify virtue with control by reason while still recognizing the importance of training one’s sentiments and emotions. If Hume had known the ethical works of Aristotle and Aquinas, he would have found that they give an important place to the emotions, and that Aquinas discusses the emotions in some detail. Such attention to the emotions does not conflict with the view that the moral virtues require subordination of the emotions to will and practical reason.
- Hume gives two reasons for rejecting the division between moral virtues and other good qualities: (1) Self-regarding as well as other-regarding traits, and excellences of intellect as well as of affection, are often counted as virtues. (2) The distinction between voluntary and involuntary does not separate real moral virtues from other qualities.²⁵ He cites the ancient moralists in support of his first claim.²⁶ He also takes them to be indifferent to the voluntary character of virtues.²⁷ He holds that Christian moralists deny both of his claims, and refers to The Whole Duty of Man.²⁸
- In his view, we would agree with him about the range of the virtues if we practised the experimental method. But Christian philosophers have not practised it, because theologicalpresuppositionshaveturnedtheirattentiontoquestionsaboutpraiseandblame.³⁷ Christian influence has made the issue about voluntariness seem important, and has warped the scope and character of moral philosophy so as to make this issue unduly prominent. 
- Hume follows Hutcheson in absorbing some of Butler’s views within a sentimentalist position. But he rejects other aspects of Butler’s position. In particular, he denies that virtue is natural to human beings.⁴⁷ He opposes the natural to the miraculous, to the unusual, and to the artificial, and argues that in none of these senses of ‘natural’ is virtue natural and vice unnatural.⁴⁸ Since these senses of ‘natural’ include all those that are relevant to naturalism about virtue, Butler’s system is unphilosophical.
None of Hume’s senses of ‘natural’, however, fits Butler. For Butler’s crucial third sense of ‘natural’ fits none of Hume’s senses. This is the sense that is relevant to Butler’s claim that what is natural for a natural organism is what is required by its whole constitution and system, as opposed to each particular part.⁴⁹ Butler does not mean simply that virtue is non-miraculous, usual, or non-artificial; hence the fact that these features do not distinguish virtue from vice does not affect Butler’s thesis.
Elsewhere Hume notices a sense of ‘natural’ that is more relevant to Butler. He suggests that Hutcheson appeals to nature in a sense that involves some teleological assumptions.
This is a reasonable interpretation of Butler’s claims too. But Hume adds, without further argument, the more questionable claim that the relevant teleological claims can be defended only by an appeal to design.⁵⁰ For reasons that he gives in his Dialogues, he believes that no sufficient empirical case can be made for the claim that natural organisms are designed for some end.⁵¹ To show that Hutcheson’s implicit claim about ends involves him in theology, Hume alludes to the first question in the Shorter Catechism (‘What is the chief end of man?’) and to the answer (‘. . . to glorify God and enjoy him for ever’).⁵² Hutcheson tries to avoid any appeal to such dogmatic claims by basing morality on nature; but Hume’s questions suggest that this attempt fails, because the teleological aspects of nature raise questions that cannot be settled by natural reason.
A teleological sense of ‘natural’ fits Butler’s claim that some things are natural for an organism because they are appropriate for the organism as a whole. But it is a further step to claim that they are appropriate because they promote the activities for which the organism was designed. Perhaps, then, Hume’s main objection to Butler claims that Butler’s normative conception of the natural relies on an ‘unphilosophical’ assumption about design. Hume is right to believe that both Butler and Hutcheson regard human beings as products of design. It does not follow, however, that a belief in design is needed to support the normative claim that an organism’s nature and constitution require one course of action rather than another. Irrespective of beliefs about design, facts about a system and constitution as a whole seem to support claims about what is natural for an organism. We rely on such claims when we say that someone needs to have a tooth extracted or needs an operation.⁵⁴ To see how far Hume departs from Butler’s naturalistic form of argument, we should consider his views on these claims about needs. 
- The Inquiry is more conciliatory than the Treatise about naturalism. Hume allows that justice is natural, since it tends to arise from the operation of natural human tendencies.⁵⁵ If we seek to contrast the natural with the artificial, we must conclude that justice is artificial rather than natural. Still, disputes about naturalness are merely verbal, since justice is also natural in a clear and acceptable sense.
These conciliatory remarks about nature do not mark a difference of substance from the Treatise. For, though they allow us to claim that virtues are natural, they do not show that they are distinctively natural; vices might equally be natural in the sense that Hume allows.
Hume goes further towards Butler’s position, however, in some of his claims about the moral sense. In the Treatise his attack on naturalism about virtue immediately follows his argument to show that the sentiments of morality are natural. According to his account of the senses of ‘natural’, he need only show that these sentiments are frequently found in human beings. But he says more than this. Though he does not affirm that virtue consists in acting in accordance with nature, he accepts part of the relevant conception of nature. In his view, human beings who have their moral sentiments extirpated and destroyed fall into disease or madness.⁵⁶ Here Hume implicitly acknowledges one clear sense, apart from those he explicitly recognizes, in which an action or condition may be natural or against nature. To say that the removal of some trait is liable to cause disease or madness is not simply to say that the trait is frequent; for many frequent traits might be removed without these effects. In speaking of disease or madness, Hume recognizes that some things are required by, or appropriate for, a human being as a whole system. Disease and madness are not simply infrequent conditions; they oppose the needs of the whole system. What the whole system needs is what Butler calls ‘natural’ in his third sense. Hume, therefore, allows that some things are natural, in Butler’s third sense. He even regards the moral sentiments as natural, in this sense.
Hume might reject this argument because it assumes that disease and madness must be understood by reference to the needs of a whole system. If he could replace this holistic and evaluative (because of ‘needs’) claim with an ‘experimental’ and purely statistical claim, he would show that truths about health and sanity do not concede the substance of Butler’s claims about appropriateness to nature. He might claim for instance that madness and disease are conditions that interfere with aims that most people share, irrespective of their upbringing and environment, and that this is what makes them natural. If he defends this claim, he accepts a version of naturalism, though it is not Butler’s version.
- Hume, in contrast to Hutcheson, does not treat Butler’s view as an alternative to the extreme rationalism of Clarke. He rejects Hutcheson’s attempted reconciliation of Butler with sentimentalism.⁶⁸ Here he is partly right and partly wrong. Hume is right to suggest that Butler’s position does not fit sentimentalism. But Hutcheson is right to suggest that Butler’s position is different from Clarke’s. Hume ignores or overlooks this difference; probably he classifies Butler with Clarke as a theorist about the ‘abstract nature of things’. This judgment is based on Butler’s non-experimental and normative conception of nature. 
- If Hume is right about the role of calm passions, prudent choices for the future depend on ignorance of future circumstances. If I made all these circumstances clear to myself, I might excite violent passions that would overcome the calm passion that underlies my prudent reasoning. His attempt to explain how we can see overriding reason to choose the prudent course of action removes the aspect of prudent action that makes it genuinely prudent. To explain and to undermine our belief that we consider the weight of reasons rather than the strength of desires, Hume concentrates on these cases where I do not know in advance what the prudent choice will cost me in the future. He fails to explain these cases. 
- But if he simply asserts that his account is exhaustive, and does not identify some further error in the claims about practical reason that he rejects, his argument should not move opponents who attribute some further function to reason. Since he does not adequately defend his account of the functions of reason, he is unwise to rely on it to support his account of justifying reasons. He would have a good case if he had shown that the justifying reasons we offer are good reasons only if we presuppose the relevant calm passions. But he has not shown this. Though some justifying reasons presuppose antecedent desires in the agent for whom they are good reasons, not all justifying reasons are of this kind.

- Hume introduces calm passions here because they are needed to show that exciting reasons always involve a passion, not because he has any other good reason for introducing them.⁴³
- Hume’s two treatments overlook the view maintained by Aquinas, and to some extent by Cudworth and Locke, that freewill consists in determination by the will, as opposed to the passions.⁴⁹ Determination by will is freedom (according to Aquinas) because the will is not determined to one course of action apart from rational reflexion, but is moved by the rational reflexion that chooses among different possible actions. Hume follows Hobbes and Hutcheson in ignoring this alleged difference between will and passion. In listing the different sources of the false belief in freedom, he does not mention Locke’s candidate—the capacity to suspend the operation of passions on the basis of rational consideration. 
- Hisargumentsonreasonandpassionseemtosupport ascepticalpositiononresponsibility.
His appeals to temporary and permanent features of agents do not support our views on responsibility, because our views rest on a conception of practical reason and the will that Hume rejects. If we agree with Hume’s view of practical reason and responsibility, our sentiments of praise and blame may not disappear; they may be stubborn, even if their rational basis is undermined. But we might doubt whether they will or should matter as much to us, if we decide that they rest on false or unjustified presuppositions about will and reason.
Here, then, we might be tempted to draw more sceptical conclusions than Hume draws.⁵⁰ His account of practical reason and prudence does not support ordinary claims about prudence, but conflicts with them. Similarly, his views about practical reason cast doubt on our conception of free and responsible agency. Contrary to Hume’s intentions, his sceptical attitude to ordinary beliefs about objectivity and personal identity seems to provide a pattern for the attitude that we will take to moral beliefs if we grasp the significance of his arguments. 
- He now defends anti-rationalism not only about practical reason and motivation, but also about morality. His discussion of reason and passion implicitly attacks Butler’s views on superior principles and self-love; he now attacks Butler’s views on conscience. Butler regards conscience as the expression of reason, as a source of moral requirements, and as a superior principle carrying authority. Hume rejects these claims.
Hume offers two distinct arguments to show that moral distinctions are not derived from reason. The first is his ‘practical argument’:¹ (1) Reason alone cannot move us to action.
(2) But moral distinctions move us to action. (3) Hence moral distinctions cannot be derived from reason. The first step is derived from Hume’s argument about the roles of reason and passion (in ii 3.3). Since Hume’s defence of his first step is open to doubt, the doubt spreads to the practical argument. 
- Hume’s second argument against rationalism is his ‘metaphysical argument’:² (1) Reason discovers only relations of ideas or matters of fact. (2) Moral truths correspond neither to relations of ideas nor to matters of fact. (3) Hence moral truths are not discovered by reason.
Again we may concede the first step to Hume for the sake of argument. In the second step he seeks to show that the moral goodness or badness of an action cannot consist in any fact about the action itself apart from the feelings of the person judging the action good or bad.
- Against a purely cognitive view of moral properties, Hume appeals to the practical aspect of morality.⁴ We believe that ‘morals have an influence on the actions and affections’ (iii 1.1.6). To see what this belief commits us to, we need to see what Hume means by ‘morals’, ‘morality’, and ‘moral distinctions’. He might have in mind (1) the properties of rightness or wrongness themselves, or (2) the moral condition—virtue or vice—of a person who acts rightly or wrongly (‘a person of good morals’). A purely cognitive view of ‘morals’ in the first sense does not imply a purely cognitive view of ‘morals’ in the second sense.
Even if moral properties are objects of rational cognition, virtue or vice need not be purely cognitive. The view that virtue is conformity to reason is not a purely cognitive view of virtue; for if a virtuous person’s will must conform to reason, such conformity to reason is not a purely cognitive condition. If Hume simply appeals to the practical effects of ‘morals’, understoodasvirtueandvice, hedoesnot refuteapurely cognitiveviewofmoral properties.⁵
- Hume’s argument against cognitivism, therefore, relies on one of two sorts of connexions between ‘morals’ and motivation:⁷ (1) If he means that duty governs me, he asserts a connexion between the existence of moral properties and motivation. He needs this connexion if his claim about motivation is to defeat an objectivist conception of moral properties. (2) If he means that my awareness of duty governs me, he asserts a connexion between my recognizing the truth of a moral judgment and my being motivated to act on it. According to this view, it is essential to a moral judgment—not to the existence of the property mentioned in the judgment—that it moves the agent to act on it. 
- If we can explain why we are normally concerned about moral questions, we can explain why moral judgments govern our action, even if they are as cognitive as judgments about the weather. To refute a purely cognitive view, Hume needs to argue that moral judgments are different from judgments about the weather because they motivate us by themselves. Is this a matter of common experience?
The task of answering this question is complicated by Hume’s discussion of reason and passion. A cognitivist might agree with Hume’s view that moral judgments by themselves can motivate us. This cognitivist believes: (1) Moral judgments by themselves motivate us. 2) Moral judgments are purely cognitive. (3) Therefore purely cognitive states sometimes motivate us. But Hume rejects this cognitivist position, because he believes: (4) Cognitive states can contribute to action only when they are suitably connected to passions that are independent of them. Hence Hume infers: (5) Moral judgments motivate us all by themselves because they imply passions and are not purely cognitive.
Hume’s position, then, depends on our being persuaded to accept (4) while still accepting (1), so that we reject (2). But might we not take (4) to be a reason for denying (1) while accept-ing (2)? Hume agrees that we have the experience of moral judgments moving us to action all by themselves, without any further desire. But he disagrees with rationalists who interpret this experience as the experience of purely cognitive states moving us to action without any non-cognitive state. Hume rejects the rationalist interpretation because he thinks we must always be moved by a passion. When we seem to be moved by moral judgments without any passion, he believes we are really moved by a calm passion distinct from any reasoning.But if we agree with Hume here, why should we not abandon our original view that we experience moral judgments by themselves moving us to action? Even if action requires passion, how can experience tell us that the relevant passion is part of the moral judgment?
Introspection does not seem to be decisive; for if the appearance of a purely cognitive state moving us to action is misleading, might the appearance of a moral judgment by itself moving us to action not be equally misleading? Hume’s claims about calm passions cast doubt on introspection; for calm passions tend to escape introspection, but we need to assume them to explain action that (to a rationalist) appears to be explained by reason alone.
Hume’s view on reason and passions seems to undermine his argument against a cognitivist account of moral judgments. If we agree with his account of reason and passion, we have no reason to trust introspection as much as we need to trust it if we are to agree that moral judgments by themselves move us to action.
Common experience, therefore, does not seem to show that moral judgments alone motivate us. But if it does not show this, it allows a purely cognitive view of moral judgments. Hume uses his conclusion about reason and passion as a premiss of his practical argument. But his arguments about reason and passion suggest that experience does not support the practical argument.
- Against internalism we may argue that the apparent impossibility of moral judgments without motivation simply reflects the regular presence of the relevant calm passions together with our moral judgments. Hume’s earlier argument helps an opponent of his argument about moral judgments and motivation. 
- According to Hume, judgments affect passions by informing them about the existence or the properties of the relevant object; if we make a false judgment about the existence of a glass of milk, or if we want a healthy drink and falsely believe that this glass of milk is healthy, our action of trying to get a glass of milk is (in the ‘abusive’ sense) unreasonable.
But the cognitivist gains nothing by appealing to this sort of unreasonableness, since it is irrelevant to the moral properties of the action or the agent.¹⁷ For if the cognitivist were right, errors of moral judgment would have to be these purely factual errors; but purely factual errors are not blameworthy, whereas errors of moral judgment are blameworthy;
hence the cognitivist is wrong.
Cognitivists might try two answers to Hume: (1) They might deny his claim that no purely factual errors are blameworthy, even if they agree that he has given a full list of factual errors. His appeal to common sense shows that many factual errors are regarded as innocent; but it does not show that all factual errors, on whatever subject and in whatever circumstances, are blameless. If, for instance, it is easy and important for us to find out some fact, and we do not find it out, we may be blameworthy for not finding it out. (2) They might reject Hume’s claim about what reason can find out, and in particular they might deny that reason can only find out about existence and about instrumental means to ends.
Aristotle and Aquinas take moral error to be a form of deliberative error about what sorts of actions and states of character promote one’s good. For the reasons we have considered, this is not purely instrumental deliberation; but error in such deliberation is error about some fact. Perhaps the Aristotelian view faces difficulties in explaining how this sort of error can be blameworthy; but it need not agree with Hume that an error about a fact is free from blame.
Since these answers are available to a cognitivist, Hume’s argument about responsibility does not refute cognitivism. 
- One of his objections attacks the anti-voluntarist view that moral right and wrong are not constituted by anyone’s will, and that they equally oblige all rational agents, including God.
He believes that the rationalist cannot defend this universal obligation; even if all rational agents knew the relevant principles, it might not motivate all of them, because knowing virtue does not imply conforming the will to it.²⁰ This objection is surprising. If Hume allows the possibility of knowing virtue without motivation, he seems to contradict the internalist claims that underlie the practical argument.
Perhaps, then, he means ‘conforming the will’ in a more demanding sense that does not simply imply some motivation, but requires overriding motivation. The objection, so understood, would be consistent with internalism. But it does not seem to damage Hume’s opponents. Rationalists have no reason to agree with Hume that universal obligation implies universal motivation, since (as we have seen) they need not accept his internalism about exciting reasons.
If the question about obligation is confined to justifying reasons, it may be an awkward question for Clarke. Why should we be concerned with the abstract relations of consistency and contradiction that Clarke identifies with moral right and wrong? This objection, however, does not apply to Butler, who tries to show how acting on reason is acting in accord with nature. 
- Hume’s second objection concerns the sort of relation that a rationalist must identify with moral rightness and wrongness.²¹ He argues that the moral badness of ingratitude cannot consist in a relation between the agents, but must consist in a spectator’s reaction to them. We should reject an objectivist answer, because the relation between the ungrateful person and the victim of ingratitude can be found in other situations that involve nothing morally wrong. The choking of a tree by one of its saplings displays the same objective relations as the murder of a parent by a child; since the latter action is wrong and the former is not, its wrongness cannot consist in an objective fact, but must consist in our reaction to it.
- Perhaps Hume has in mind a further argument to show that a complete description does not include moral badness. He may argue: (1) If the moral badness of murder is a property of the murder itself, it must be identical to some objective property F-ness (where ‘F’ is some predicate other than ‘moral goodness’). (2) But whatever we choose as F-ness, it is conceivable that two observers agree that murder is F, but disagree about whether it is morally bad. (3) If such disagreement is conceivable, Fness is not identical to its moral badness. (4) Hence no objective property of murder is identical to its moral badness.
This argument begs a question against Price, who does not accept the first premiss. Price agrees with this premiss only if ‘complex property’ or ‘definable property’ is substituted in the antecedent for ‘property’. With this substitution, Price uses the argument to show that moral properties are simple and indefinable. Hume gives no reason for accepting his first premiss, and so he gives no reason for preferring his account of moral properties over Price’s.²⁷ For similar reasons, Hume’s argument might be adapted to support Moore’s view that goodness is a simple non-natural property. According to Moore, Hume’s first premiss is a mistake that Moore connects with the Naturalistic Fallacy.²⁸ If we waive this objection to Hume’s first step, and grant that if moral properties are objective, they are also complex and definable, we might still question Hume’s third step.
Perhaps A and B disagree because B supposes something self-contradictory. In that case, what A believes may still be true, and indeed necessarily true, even if B disagrees with it.
Perhaps, then, Hume means to avoid this objection, by claiming that if ‘F-ness is badness’ can be denied without evident contradiction, F-ness is not identical to badness.
This reply is hardly convincing. Even if it does not appear self-contradictory to suppose that deliberately killing an innocent person is not bad, the deliberate killing may still be the moral badness in the action. We may grant that if two properties are really identical, their identity is necessary, but we need not agree that the necessity is logical necessity.²⁹
- But let us concede that if F-ness is badness, ‘F-ness is not bad’ is self-contradictory. Hume still faces difficulties that raise a wider question about his strategy. He seems to assume that if something appears to be conceivable (murder’s not being wrong, for instance), it is conceivable, and is therefore possible.³⁰ On this point he agrees with Moore’s Open Question Argument. Moore maintains that if it does not immediately appear self-contradictory to say that x is F but x is not good, goodness is not F-ness. Both Hume and Moore make it too easy to reject proposed definitions.³¹ Hume’s use of this argument is especially surprising in the light of his practical argument.
For internalism implies that it is inconceivable, and therefore logically impossible, to judge that doing x is morally right without being moved to do x. If we understood that moral judgments include motivation, we would also understand that what we took to be conceivable (that someone could judge that X is bad, but do X after that - Tim. B.) is in fact impossible, and therefore inconceivable. If this is a reasonable defence of Hume’s practical argument against a claim about conceivability, it suggests an objectivist answer to Hume’s metaphysical argument. If we think it is conceivable for something to meet all the conditions for deliberate murder without being bad, we simply show our ignorance of badness.
Hume, therefore, assumes in his metaphysical argument a test for possibility that undermines his practical argument. In the practical argument he assumes that we must test and (if necessary) correct intuitions about conceivability in the light of prior judgments about possibility. In the metaphysical argument, however, he assumes that we must form judgments about possibility in the light of prior intuitions about conceivability. Since his assumptions about conceivability and possibility in each case are implicit, he does not see that they conflict. But since they conflict, his practical argument and his metaphysical argument cannot both be sound.
Hume would avoid this dilemma if his practical argument did not rely on the logical impossibility of separating moral judgments from motivation. If he could show that it is simply a well-confirmed empirical generalization that moral judgments motivate by themselves, his practical argument would not rest on a claim about conceivability and possibility that conflicts with the claim underlying his metaphysical argument. We saw, however, that empirical arguments face objections arising from Hume’s doctrine of calm passions (When we seem to be moved by moral judgments without any passion, he believes we are really moved by a calm passion distinct from any reasoning.
But if we agree with Hume here, why should we not abandon our original view that we experience moral judgments by themselves moving us to action? Even if action requires passion, how can experience tell us that the relevant passion is part of the moral judgment?
Introspection does not seem to be decisive; for if the appearance of a purely cognitive state moving us to action is misleading, might the appearance of a moral judgment by itself moving us to action not be equally misleading? Hume’s claims about calm passions cast doubt on introspection; for calm passions tend to escape introspection, but we need to assume them to explain action that (to a rationalist) appears to be explained by reason alone.
Hume’s view on reason and passions seems to undermine his argument against a cognitivist account of moral judgments. If we agree with his account of reason and passion, we have no reason to trust introspection as much as we need to trust it if we are to agree that moral judgments by themselves move us to action.
Common experience, therefore, does not seem to show that moral judgments alone motivate us. But if it does not show this, it allows a purely cognitive view of moral judgments. Hume uses his conclusion about reason and passion as a premiss of his practical argument. But his arguments about reason and passion suggest that experience does not support the practical argument). 
He seems to have no easy alternative to an argument from logical impossibility;
and therefore he seems to face the dilemma we have described.
- Hume might try a different objection against the claim that the badness of the murder is a property of the murder itself. He might point out that we could recognize all the properties of the murder itself and still be quite unmoved by them. This argument assumes that the badness of an action must be something that motivates the person making the judgment of badness to condemn the action or to avoid doing it. a complete grasp of the properties of a murder may not result in the sentiment characteristic of morality.
Hume’s argument about the poem seems to assume that we cannot be aware of beauty without feeling the right sentiment.³⁴ Similarly, he assumes, we cannot recognize the moral properties of an action without being motivated to act. Since we can recognize all the properties of the object itself without being motivated, moral properties are not properties of the object itself. This argument might be understood in other ways: (1) The claim that beauty is not an objective property of the poem is a premiss from which we infer that the mathematician knows everything in the poem even without knowing its beauty. (2) The premiss says that he knows everything in the poem, and the conclusion says that beauty is not in the poem.
(1) makes theargumentuseless for provingthatbeautyis notin thepoem. (2) requires us to agree, withoutbeinggiven any reason, that the mathematician knows all the properties in the poem. Neither interpretation provides a good argument
- Hume’s argument about the poem seems to assume that we cannot be aware of beauty without feeling the right sentiment.³⁴ Similarly, he assumes, we cannot recognize the moral properties of an action without being motivated to act. Since we can recognize all the properties of the object itself without being motivated, moral properties are not properties of the object itself.
This interpretation gives Hume the best argument. It offers to explain and to justify the assumption underlying the metaphysical argument. That argument assumes that moral properties are not among the properties of the object itself, and this assumption is justified because moral properties are essentially connected with motivation, but facts about the object itself could not be essentially connected with motivation. If this is what Hume means, he believes that the practical character of moral judgments gives the basic reason for the failure of objectivism. So understood, the argument closes a gap. We noticed that the metaphysical argument simply assumed that moral goodness could not be a simple objective property, and so left room for Price’s view (later revived by Moore). The practical argument closes this gap; a simple objective property would not be essentially connected with motivation, and hence could not be the moral property. Price and Moore can exploit the metaphysical argument to show that goodness is not a complex property describable by some predicate other than ‘good’, and can still maintain an objectivist conclusion. But they cannot so easily maintain objectivism against the metaphysical argument supported by the practical argument.
- Balguy’sargument about voluntarism issimply an application of a broader argument that seems to cast doubt on sentimentalism. This broader argument claims that sentimentalism makes moral facts mutable in ways that we know they are not mutable. We do not believe an action would cease to be right if the only facts that changed were facts about an observer’s reactions.²² If, for instance, the torture of innocent children for pleasure became so common that it no longer shocked observers, though it still hurt the victims just as much, it would not cease to be wrong simply because most people had become more callous.²³ But sentimentalists are committed to claiming that the moral facts change in such a case. Hume agrees with Balguy’s claim that sentimentalism implies this degree of mutability in moral facts and properties. But he does not agree that this casts doubt on sentimentalism. For he does not agree that moral facts and properties are immutable in the way that Balguy suggests. If they appear to us to be immutable, we are mistaken because we have not yet grasped the nature of moral properties. Once we see that moral facts depend on our reactions, we must simply accept their mutability. This is a good reason for dismissing Balguy’s objections only if the grounds for believing sentimentalism are stronger than the grounds for believing in immutability. Does Hume prove this point? His practical argument rests on internalism about motivation; but it is not clear that we are more convinced of internalism than of immutability. His metaphysical argument assumes that we can recognize all the objective facts without recognizing any moral fact; but Balguy might reply that we can equally recognize a change in observers’ reactions without recognizing a change in the moral facts. It would not be enough for Hume’s purposes to show that internalism is no less plausible than Balguy’s claims about immutability. If his claims and Balguy’s claims are equally plausible, we should conclude that both internalism and objectivism are true. If these two conclusions are incompatible, we should conclude that moral facts and properties have incompatible features, and hence we should be nihilists or sceptics. Hume can avoid this conclusion if he can show that his internalist claims are more plausible than Balguy’s claims about immutability. But it is difficult to be convinced of this without an explicit confrontation between the two lines of argument. 
- Has he shown that we can have no moral concern with a just action considered in itself? In making this broad negative claim, Hume does not consider the possibility that we might care about equal treatment for relevantly similar actions, or equal responses to equal needs, apart from the benefti or harm to the agents involved. He therefore seems to set aside the deontological considerations that Butler opposes to all attempts to reduce morality to concern for the public interest. Hume seems to think he has disqualified all such considerations through his argument to show that the motive for being just cannot be regard for the justness of the action. He argues that such regard for the justness of the action would require an antecedent regard for the virtue of justice, and this is the very thing we are trying to explain. Hume’s argument, however, does not distinguish the goodness of actions from the goodness of agents.²² We might say that an action tending to treat people according to what they have done, or to match reward or punishment to the degree of intentional benefit or harm, is good in itself. Hence we might approve the attitude that cares about treating equal cases equally, matching reward and punishment to actions, and so on, because we value these actions. Such a motive constitutes justice, and it is not clear why it should not be a natural object of esteem. Let us, however, waive these objections to Hume, and concede that we must derive the moral goodness of justice from its relation to some consequences that we approve of. In that case, his point about justice is that our approval has to depend on our views about the system of justice that prescribes this particular just action. If this is right, does it mark a difference between justice and the virtues that Hume regards as natural? Actions proceeding from the natural virtues sometimes seem to result from consideration of their consequences or of the system of which they form a part. If your child has inherited money, and you do not allow him to spend it immediately as he pleases, but insist on its being saved or invested for his future use, your action is an act of benevolence. But Hume’s sympathetic observer might notice that your action causes immediate distress and no obvious immediate benefit to the child. To see that the action is evidence of your benevolent motive, the observer must look at the general facts about people and societies that make this the best thing to do in the child’s interest. Some of these facts are of the sort that Hume regards as conventions—arrangements about the use of money to buy commodities, about the accumulation of money from investment, and so on. But even though all this has to be taken into account, your action was benevolent, and evidence of a benevolent character. If, then, Hume seeks to distinguish artificial from natural virtues on the ground that various social facts and consequences have to be considered if we are to understand the system that makes artifciial virtues benefciial, he faces a diffciulty. He does not show that justice is any more artificial than benevolence; for the same sorts of facts may be relevant to benevolence. Hume does not discuss this question about his division, because he illustrates the natural virtue of benevolence with a rather narrow range of examples. He mentions benevolent actions in which, for instance, ‘a parent flies to the relief of his child’ (I, App 3.2), and no particular foresight or understanding is needed. Such examples are misleading, however, because benevolence is not confnied to cases where the benefti is obvious. Concern for longer-term benefits does not distinguish the virtue of benevolence from the virtue of justice; it may simply distinguish one sort of benevolent action from another. Hume’s contrast between benevolence and justice may result from his treatment of benevolence as a sentiment that reacts to the immediate appearance of good and harm to others. If he thinks of benevolence as a natural virtue that rests on this sentiment, he might reasonably infer that it ignores consequences. This conception of benevolence makes it plausible to say that just actions often do not appeal to benevolence and unjust actions often appeal to it. But one might doubt whether the spontaneous expression of an unreflective sentiment of benevolence is really a virtue. Butler sees this point, and therefore distinguishes the passion of benevolence from the rational principle. While the consideration of consequences may be alien to the passion of benevolence, it is often necessary for a virtue of benevolence, which rests on the rational principle.²³ Though Hume does not accept the basis of Butler’s distinction, which rests on the division between passions and superior principles, he seems to recognize a type of benevolence that differsfromtheunrefelctivesentiment. Forhesometimesdescribestheprincipleofhumanity as benevolence; the benevolence he has in mind here must be sensitive to consideration of consequences. It is more plausible to count this reflective attitude as a virtue than to count the unreflective sentiment. Even if reflective benevolence is not utilitarian, it considers the long-term interest of the person or people who engage our benevolent concern. When we are clear about the relevant conception of benevolence, Hume’s way of distinguishing natural from artificial virtues seems less convincing.
