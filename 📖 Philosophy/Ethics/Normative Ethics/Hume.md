- Role of a rational part of the soul is only an instrumental one
- It is not rational to plan the better way of fullfilling the desire
- Rejects the supremacy of reasons based on one’s own good for being moral
- Holistic Naturalism (Human nature os a system of some tendencies of people. But not all tendencies are part of human nature) is false. Hume does not believe that all claims about human nature must be excluded from moral philosophy, but he rejects the naturalist position that we have outlined. Everything whar people do is a human's nature
- Hume anticipates many of Nietzsche’s alleged ‘insights’; he attacks emphasis on ‘morality’ and responsibility without even knowing about Kant, who is a primary target of Nietzsche, MacIntyre, and Williams.
- Virtues of character are sufficient to be virtuous
- In unself i sh concern A wants to do x for B, simply because B wants x done or because it would be better for B, not because A gains any further benef i t from doing x. A shows this concern for B if A moves to one side to avoid walking over B’s gouty toes, when A has nothing else to gain by doing this. This is the unself i sh sentiment whose reality Hume (e.g.) defend against the psychological egoism of Hobbes
- In his view, the difference between simply entertaining a proposition and believing it consists in the degree of vividness with which you entertain it; it is an introspectible property of the idea itself.
- He argues that the attempt to f i nd a rational basis for moral beliefs is a philosophical undertaking whose failure makes no difference to the ordinary way we hold our beliefs. Just as our belief that the sun will rise tomorrow is undisturbed even when we see that it lacks rational justif i cation, our moral sentiments are unaffected even when we see that they lack rational foundation.
- Sentimentalism is true: the extent to which we are capable of sympathy defines the extent of concern.
- The anti-rationalist position of Hutcheson claims that the different specific ends people pursue reflect their different desires, inclinations, and attitudes, and must ultimately be explained by these, rather than by their different rational beliefs about anything.
- Hume accepts compatibilism, but does not believe that it removes objections to predestination. 
- false judgments cannot be the source of immorality
- freedom consists simply in internal determination; he sees no relevant distinction between the will and the ‘sentiments’ or ‘passions’ as sources of the internal determination.
He rejects both an indeterminist and an intellectualist account of freedom.¹⁸ Though he accepts the voluntarist criticisms of intellectualism far enough to believe that determination by intellect is not freedom, he does not regard voluntarism as an adequate alternative.
Against both intellectualists and voluntarists, he concludes that the will is a passion. 
- Hume’s argument about ‘is’ and ‘ought’:
we have given the wrong account of a moral judgment if our account allows someone to believe that a moral judgment is true without having any motive to act on it.
- Hume believes that justice is appropriate only in specific external circumstances that do not follow from human nature itself.⁷⁰ The competition that leads to a state of war results from human nature only in conditions of scarcity. 
- Hume intends his moral sense theory to express anti-realism and the rejection of independent morality. HE believes that he continues and develops Hutcheson’s approach to morality, and especially his account of the moral sense
- oppose theological voluntarism. 
- Later believers in a moral sense, Hume and Hutcheson, reject moral realism
- Since the only intelligible account of moral properties makes them dependent on the reactions of the moral sense, our view that they are non-arbitrary and immutable in certain ways turns out to be unjustified.⁵⁶
- Balguy’s criticism of Hutcheson convinces not only Butler and Price, but also Hume.
For Hume implicitly agrees that Hutcheson cannot combine his sentimentalist objections to Clarke with his realist defence of Shaftesbury, because his sentimentalism conflicts with realism. Butler and Price argue that in the face of this we should give up sentimentalism, but Hume decides to give up realism instead.
- Both Hume and Price notice that Hutcheson’s position on authority is unsatisfactory. In Hume’s view, the concession to Butler is a mistake. In Price’s view, Hutcheson is right to agree with Butler, but wrong to suppose that the moral sense meets Butler’s conditions for an authoritative principle.²⁰ Both critics argue, from their opposite points of view, that Hutcheson can restore consistency to his position only by moving either to a more rationalist or to a more anti-rationalist view.
- The normative pretensions of previous moral philosophy appear to Hume to be misguided. But why does he think so? In claiming that the science of man allows us to ‘conquer’ the sciences that more intimately concern human life, he might mean that the experimental study of human nature provides a basis for better-founded normative claims about how human beings ought to be. Alternatively, he might mean that experimental study conquers moral philosophy by expelling the normative element that is distinct from experimental study. We need to see which of these two views expresses Hume’s claim about the significance of experimental moral science.
- Sometimes, however, Hume attacks the basis of common-sense beliefs. His discussion of induction seems to affect the rational basis of all our beliefs about ‘matters of fact’. His argument about personal identity seems to attack not only metaphysical theories of personal identity, but also the belief that I am the same person through the normal changes in my mental states. Similarly, the sceptical discussion of the senses casts doubt on both the vulgar belief and the more circumspect (as Hume supposes) philosophical belief in external objects.
Hume takes his scepticism to be pervasive, since it shows that our beliefs about causes and effects and our beliefs about external objects undermine each other (i 4.7, 4). But we cannot give up either of these sets of beliefs.
- If Hume’s premisses seem to lead by valid arguments to absurd conclusions, ought we to doubt the truth of his premisses? Hume does not think so. In his view, sceptical philosophy and common sense are in permanent tension. Sceptical arguments encourage him to reject all beliefs.⁵ Common life does not refute the sceptical arguments, but it weakens their influence.
Since we have to act, we cannot (he claims) maintain complete suspension of belief.
Still, sceptical philosophy changes our attitude to our common-sense beliefs. If we are sceptics, we recognize that we hold our ordinary beliefs because they are entrenched and we cannot easily get rid of them, not because we think the evidence warrants them.⁶ This is not our normal attitude—before we become sceptics—to our everyday beliefs. If we agree with Hume that sceptical arguments undermine the justification of everyday beliefs, we cannot turn our back on sceptical conclusions when we engage in the activities of everyday life.
- A sceptical point of view does not undermine every impulse to philosophical inquiry, but it changes the character of the inquiry. If we are sceptics, we ask psychological rather than normative questions. Instead of asking what is morally good or bad, we ask what causes us to judge one thing good and another bad.

- But Martineau and Hume over-estimate the degree to which Hutcheson agrees with Butler. Though he goes some way towards acceptance of Butler’s view of conscience, he stops short on one crucial point. In Butler’s view, superior principles essentially appeal to authority rather than mere strength. If conscience is supreme, it is also most authoritative.
If it has authority to decide the questions it decides, it appeals to considerations that take legitimate precedence over the considerations that lower principles appeal to. One might infer that a supreme principle, so understood, must be a rational principle. But Hutcheson rejects that inference. He does not treat the moral sense as rational.
