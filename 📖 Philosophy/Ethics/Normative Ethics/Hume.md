- Role of a rational part of the soul is only an instrumental one
- It is not rational to plan the better way of fullfilling the desire
- Rejects the supremacy of reasons based on one’s own good for being moral
- Holistic Naturalism (Human nature os a system of some tendencies of people. But not all tendencies are part of human nature) is false. Hume does not believe that all claims about human nature must be excluded from moral philosophy, but he rejects the naturalist position that we have outlined. Everything whar people do is a human's nature
- Hume anticipates many of Nietzsche’s alleged ‘insights’; he attacks emphasis on ‘morality’ and responsibility without even knowing about Kant, who is a primary target of Nietzsche, MacIntyre, and Williams.
- Virtues of character are sufficient to be virtuous
- In unself i sh concern A wants to do x for B, simply because B wants x done or because it would be better for B, not because A gains any further benef i t from doing x. A shows this concern for B if A moves to one side to avoid walking over B’s gouty toes, when A has nothing else to gain by doing this. This is the unself i sh sentiment whose reality Hume (e.g.) defend against the psychological egoism of Hobbes
- In his view, the difference between simply entertaining a proposition and believing it consists in the degree of vividness with which you entertain it; it is an introspectible property of the idea itself.
- He argues that the attempt to f i nd a rational basis for moral beliefs is a philosophical undertaking whose failure makes no difference to the ordinary way we hold our beliefs. Just as our belief that the sun will rise tomorrow is undisturbed even when we see that it lacks rational justif i cation, our moral sentiments are unaffected even when we see that they lack rational foundation.
- Sentimentalism is true: the extent to which we are capable of sympathy defines the extent of concern.
- The anti-rationalist position of Hutcheson claims that the different specific ends people pursue reflect their different desires, inclinations, and attitudes, and must ultimately be explained by these, rather than by their different rational beliefs about anything.
- Hume accepts compatibilism, but does not believe that it removes objections to predestination. 
- false judgments cannot be the source of immorality
- freedom consists simply in internal determination; he sees no relevant distinction between the will and the ‘sentiments’ or ‘passions’ as sources of the internal determination.
He rejects both an indeterminist and an intellectualist account of freedom.¹⁸ Though he accepts the voluntarist criticisms of intellectualism far enough to believe that determination by intellect is not freedom, he does not regard voluntarism as an adequate alternative.
Against both intellectualists and voluntarists, he concludes that the will is a passion. 
- Hume’s argument about ‘is’ and ‘ought’:
we have given the wrong account of a moral judgment if our account allows someone to believe that a moral judgment is true without having any motive to act on it.
- Hume believes that justice is appropriate only in specific external circumstances that do not follow from human nature itself.⁷⁰ The competition that leads to a state of war results from human nature only in conditions of scarcity. 
- Hume intends his moral sense theory to express anti-realism and the rejection of independent morality. HE believes that he continues and develops Hutcheson’s approach to morality, and especially his account of the moral sense
- oppose theological voluntarism. 
- Later believers in a moral sense, Hume and Hutcheson, reject moral realism
- Since the only intelligible account of moral properties makes them dependent on the reactions of the moral sense, our view that they are non-arbitrary and immutable in certain ways turns out to be unjustified.⁵⁶
- Balguy’s criticism of Hutcheson convinces not only Butler and Price, but also Hume.
For Hume implicitly agrees that Hutcheson cannot combine his sentimentalist objections to Clarke with his realist defence of Shaftesbury, because his sentimentalism conflicts with realism. Butler and Price argue that in the face of this we should give up sentimentalism, but Hume decides to give up realism instead.
