- Christianity neither fulfils nor destroys Greek morality, because it does not take a moral position. Christianity displays the pointlessness of trying to satisfy God with our moral goodness; we can never succeed, and Christianity tells us we can achieve salvation without moral virtue. On this view, Christianity tells us about our relations with God, not about how to get on with other people. It is still important to get on with other people, and we need moral reflexion to tell us how to do it; but this is a separate area from religion. Theology does not prescribe the principles of medicine or agriculture, and we have no more reason to expect it to prescribe the principles of ethics. From this point of view, both of the previous approaches to Christianity and ethics rest on the same false assumption, that Christianity has ethical implications that make it either a fulfilment of Greek ethics or a challenge to it.
- Aristotle recognizes the possibility of becoming virtuous by our own efforts and through our own will. If we agree with him, we seem to raise difficulties for the Christian belief in the ubiquity of sin; this is why Luther believes that the incorporation of Aristotelian ethics is a fatal dilution of the Christian conception of human nature.
- Christian doctrine require the decisive rejection of an Aristotelian framework
- Prudence of the flesh (particular prudence) is a self-love without qualification
- Christianity requires new theoretical framework (apart from tge Aristotle’s one) 
- Christian virtues are other-worldly and do not apply in our world
- Voluntarism about God's will is true - God makes someting good by its will
- Eudaemonism is false: Luther rejects that we can aquire virtues if we start from the self-love. To acquire virtues we must start from the love of our neighbour. If we love ourselves, we can't love God
- All virtues of pagans are really just vices
- The desire for self-happiness is universal in all human beings
- About freewill:
    - Independence from external actions - we have it
    - Independence from external causes - we don't have it
- After receiving God's grace, people will want to perform good actions
- Maybe, Luther sees 2 graces, given by God:
    - Justifying grace  - forgives previoius sins
    - Sanctifying grace - gives people the ability to perform good actions
- There is no infused moral virtues
- Good actions are nothing more than consequences of God's justification
- Good actions can't give us God's mercy
- Though Butler does not mention natural law, he introduces it, as Clarke does, by appeal to St Paul’s claim that human beings are by nature a law to themselves (Rm. 2:15).³⁴ Aquinas cites this passage as a Scriptural warrant for including a doctrine of natural law in Christian moral theology. Luther and Calvin, among many others, agree with Aquinas.³⁵
