- Anti-eudaemonism: we value virtue appropriately only if we do not regard it as a part of, or a means to, our happiness
- Stoics and Peripatetics differs only verbally in the question of no passions vs moderate passions
- Augustine enthusiastically insists on the pervasiveness and inevitability of sin, and so he might reasonably be expected to reject the assumptions that underlie Socratic moral psychology.
- Augustine explains st. Pauline moral psychology by reference to Stoic doctrine, as he understands it
- Augustine’s interpretation of the Stoic view tends to assimilate it to an Aristotelian view.
- Augustine acknowledges that Platonists reject Manichean cosmic dualism, but, in his view, they do not entirely free themselves from Manichean error; for they believe that the body is the source of sin by being the source of non-rational desire (CD xiv 5b).
- Augustine rejects the quasi-Platonic and Manichean view, because it introduces two antagonistic wills.¹¹ This view eliminates the single deliberating agent, and substitutes a conf l ict whose outcome is independent of our choice. Though Augustine also sometimes recognizes two ‘wills’, he does not have two Manichean wills in mind. He simply refers to two tendencies of the will; he refuses to take the extra step of allowing that these are the expressions of two opposed minds or (we might say) personalities that simply conf l ict, without having anything to say to each other. He insists that ‘it was I who was willing and I who was unwilling; I was I’ (Conf. viii 22). He thinks this view completely undermine unif i ed agency, rational control, and responsibility for sin.
- He seeks, therefore, an account of will, passion, and action that avoids both the radical voluntarist account of Adam and Eve and the radical dualism that exploits the Pauline division between f l esh and spirit.
- To overcome Manichean psychological dualism, we might claim on Augustine’s behalf that the same will is involved in the choices of the f l esh and of the spirit, in so far as we ‘identify’ ourselves with each sort of choice.¹⁵
