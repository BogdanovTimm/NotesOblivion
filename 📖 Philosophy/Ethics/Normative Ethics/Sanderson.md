- Like Hooker, he defends this view about natural reason against those who insist on explicit Scriptural authority for any principle or norm binding on Christians. But he is closer than Hooker to voluntarism.¹⁹ His voluntarist tendencies result partly from his emphasis on obligation. Unlike Suarez, he is not clear on the relation between obligations and oughts, and so it is difficult to say how far he goes towards voluntarism. 
- He claims first that obligation comes primarily from the command of God, which is the only thing that properly obliges (4.5–6). Correct reason is a secondary rule (4.12). Though it is secondary to the Scriptures in authority, it is also independent of them, so that it guides those who do not know, or do not accept, the Scriptures. In one way it is even prior to the Scriptures; for we need something apart from the Scriptures to identify the moral principles in the Scriptures. Since the Scriptures combine moral precepts with purely ceremonial and judicial precepts, and since they do not tell us which ones are the moral precepts, we need natural reason to say what makes some principles morally required.²⁰ The ‘innate light’ for practical reason comes from the natural law, which moves us to live according to nature as rational beings (4.24).
 

# Difficulties

- Sanderson’s silence on intrinsic morality weakens some of his arguments against those who recognize no moral principles apart from divine commands. He argues that we cannot even use the Scriptures intelligently if we do not rely on moral judgments and principles that are not explicitly announced in the Scriptures (4.16–17). This argument would have been stronger if he had insisted that moral principles are commanded by God because of their intrinsic rightness. While Sanderson may have this point in mind against his opponents, he does not make it clear. 
- In allowing that the natural law requires us to live in a particular way, Sanderson seems to concede that its principles constitute moral requirements apart from any divine legislation. They depend on the will of God as creator, since beings with our nature would not exist without God’s choosing to create us; but they do not seem to depend on divine legislation, since they would still (we might suppose) be moral requirements for us even if God had not also ordered us to obey them. Sanderson does not say exactly what he thinks on this question. For he maintains that the provisions of natural law are also a law imposed by God, thereby producing obligation. In connecting law with an obligation imposed by a command of the legislator, he agrees with Suarez. It is more difficult, because of the brevity of his discussion, to say whether he also agrees with Suarez’s view that God’s commands necessarily agree with the intrinsic morality that belongs to actions by their nature independently of divine commands. In speaking of action in accordance with nature, Sanderson may be taken to recognize intrinsic morality independent of obligation (as he conceives it); but he does not emphasize it. His failure to emphasize it may reflect his legislative approach to conscience.
