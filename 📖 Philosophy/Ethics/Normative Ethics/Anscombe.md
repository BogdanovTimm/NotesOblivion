- She argues, contrary to both Sidgwick and Barbeyrac (who claim that medieval philosophers do not hold jural conception of morailty), that mediaeval Christian moralists hold a jural conception. They identified basic moral principles with the precepts of the Decalogue, understood as a body of divine legislation.²⁸
- The Reformers abandon this jural conception of morality because of the Lutheran separation between law and Gospel; in contrast to the mediaeval view about the scope of divine law, Luther claims that it applies only to unregenerate humanity.²⁹
- Given this hostility to law (Anscombe claims), Protestants reject a jural conception of morality as a positive guide to life (though it serves to reveal sin).
- In Anscombe’s view, modern moralists have developed a non-jural outlook, but imperfectly, since they have retained beliefs in obligation that presuppose a jural conception. 
- In Anscombe’s view, Sidgwick has overlooked the historical evidence showing that a jural conception is prevalent in mediaeval Christian moral philosophy. 
- Aristotle uses ‘should’ and ‘ought’ with reference to goodness and badness, but not in the special moral sense that these terms have now acquired.³¹ Since Aristotle does not use these terms with the special moral sense, he does not have a concept of the moral. 
- Ansomb claims that modern moral philosophy abandons a jural conception.

- We have good reason to doubt Anscombe’s view that a jural conception of morality is characteristic of Scholasticism. The prominence of natural law in Aquinas’ account does not imply that he takes acts of legislation to be essential to morality. Given his broad conception of natural law, his belief that morality is essentially natural law does not commit him to a jural conception of morality. He holds a naturalist view that makes natural law essentially an indicative law, but not essentially a prescriptive law. 
- Anscombe’s claim that medieval Christian philosopher all hold a jural coneption of morality might fit Scotus and Ockham better, but it conflicts with the positions of Aquinas and Suarez.
