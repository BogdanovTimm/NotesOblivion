- Cudworth defends eternal and immutable morality, as he conceives it, both against the positivism that he traces back to Protagoras and against the theological voluntarism that he attributes to Ockham, mediaeval theologians, ‘modern’ theologians, and Descartes. From Cudworth’s point of view, the mediaeval voluntarists abandon the view that morality has rational foundations.
Cudworth does not invent this assessment of voluntarism; he relies on the critique of Ockham by Suarez, who cannot be accused of ignorance of Scholasticism or of raising anachronistic questions. This assessment of Scotus and Ockham may not be correct, since they may not accept all the views that later critics, or later followers, connect with voluntarism. They both understand morality as conformity to correct reason. 
- According to rationalist critics, Hobbes is more deeply mistaken. Cudworth and Clarke attack all attempts to vindicate morality by reducing normative facts (i.e., facts about what we ought to do, and what we have reason to do) to non-normative psychological facts (about what we are in fact moved to do)
- he maintains a connexion between reason and morality 
- oppose theological voluntarism. 
- The Aristotelian conception makes the grasp of natural law a part of the rational grasp of the ultimate end by rational agents.
- According to Cudworth, a legislative account of morality makes morality mutable in the wrong way, since it implies that if God had legislated differently, it would have been right (e.g.) to murder, cheat, and torture, and that therefore morality is mutable in relation to divine legislation.
- Cudworth tries to refute these two aspects of Hobbes’s attack on the Scholastic position. 
- On the crucial points about the freedom of the will and the natural character of morality, he believes Aristotle is right and Hobbes is wrong. Hobbes’s errors reflect not only a mistaken approach to ethics, but also a mistaken approach to basic questions of epistemology and metaphysics. His position is a revival of the ‘Democritic doctrine’ that Cudworth sees in ancient atomism and empiricism. In Cudworth’s view, the ancient doctrine of Democritus and Epicurus, recently revived by Gassendi and Hobbes, rests on an indefensible metaphysics.
- He rejects three positions: (1) Hobbes’s version ofdeterminism andanti-rationalism; (2) theintellectualist position ofAquinas; (3) the voluntarist and libertarian conception of the will. On the first two points he agrees with Bramhall, but disagrees with him on the third, since Bramhall accepts the voluntarist claims that Cudworth criticizes. His criticisms of these three positions and his attempts to develop a fourth position are worth considering, even though it is not clear exactly what position he eventually maintains, or how it differs from the three positions he rejects.
- He rejects that the will and understanding are mutually exclusive; the will is not ‘blind’, as it would, if it would include no element of understanding. Both Scholastic views are wrong, in Cudworth’s view, because they treat the will and the understanding as though they were two distinct subjects (FW, ch. 7 = H 170–1). To speak of the understanding ‘propounding’ to the will, or ‘alluring’ or ‘inviting’ the will, and of the will as ‘following’ or ‘refusing to comply’ is to treat them as two distinct agents. But this treatment would be reasonable only if each of them were a real agent, and hence had both understanding and will. If we treat the will as an agent without understanding, we cannot fnid a satisfactory account of freedom. For if it is entirely blind, either it thoughtlessly follows understanding (as the pure intellectualist view claims) or it thoughtlessly and capriciously chooses to follow or not to follow understanding. In trying to explain intelligible choices by a real agent, who is a person with both understanding and will, we resort to unintelligible choices by a spurious agent, the blind will.  He rejects both:
    - The pure intellectualist view claims that the understanding alone determines the will. He rejects the pure intellectualist view as denying freewill.
    - A more complex view claims that the will ‘determines the understanding both to exercise, and specifciation of objects’. He rejects the more complex view for two reasons: (1) It is viciously circular, because it treats the will as ‘blind’ in itself; the will determines the understanding only insofar as the understanding presents something to it, so that it is really determined by the understanding.¹¹ (2) It does not safeguard freewill, because an undetermined but blind will would act capriciously and randomly, which is contrary to genuine freedom.¹² There must be both an action of the understanding going before every act of the will, and also an act of the will going before every act of the understanding, which is further contradictious and impossible.’
- He is rather hasty in assuming that indeterminism implies random and capricious motion that could not be a subject for praise and blame. The voluntarist might reply that when we choose the apparently greater good, we choose it because it appears greater, even though the causal connexion is not deterministic. We might fairly ask the voluntarist, however, why the non-deterministic character of the causal connexion is necessary for the choice to be free and responsible; on this point Cudworth has identified a reasonable objection to voluntarist indeterminism.











#                  Difficulties

- Cudworth is mistaken, therefore, if he believes that recognition of freedom of specification and of exercise precludes an intellectualist account of the will. We reject intellectualism only if we take the will to be undetermined even by the last act of judgment,¹⁴ so that in the same circumstances the will is capable of going in different directions.¹⁵
- He rejects determinism, if this is understood as the doctrine that everything is necessitated by previous events; he takes Buridan’s ass to show the presence of contingency in some choices (FW, ch. = H 164). He does not believe, however, that voluntary and responsible action is to be identified with this sort of contingency (FW, ch. 5 = H 166). Sometimes he suggests that we are responsible for an error if further consideration would have caused us to avoid the error by better judgment (FW, ch. 10 = H 179). He adds, however, that this further consideration must also be possible for us, and that this possibility requires the absence of determination by ‘antecedent necessary causes'. It is difficult to say how strongly or how consistently Cudworth believes that freedom from the necessity of nature requires the absence of determination.
