- Cudworth defends eternal and immutable morality, as he conceives it, both against the positivism that he traces back to Protagoras and against the theological voluntarism that he attributes to Ockham, mediaeval theologians, ‘modern’ theologians, and Descartes. From Cudworth’s point of view, the mediaeval voluntarists abandon the view that morality has rational foundations.
Cudworth does not invent this assessment of voluntarism; he relies on the critique of Ockham by Suarez, who cannot be accused of ignorance of Scholasticism or of raising anachronistic questions. This assessment of Scotus and Ockham may not be correct, since they may not accept all the views that later critics, or later followers, connect with voluntarism. They both understand morality as conformity to correct reason. 
- According to rationalist critics, Hobbes is more deeply mistaken. Cudworth and Clarke attack all attempts to vindicate morality by reducing normative facts (i.e., facts about what we ought to do, and what we have reason to do) to non-normative psychological facts (about what we are in fact moved to do)
- he maintains a connexion between reason and morality 
- oppose theological voluntarism. 
- The Aristotelian conception makes the grasp of natural law a part of the rational grasp of the ultimate end by rational agents.
- According to Cudworth, a legislative account of morality makes morality mutable in the wrong way, since it implies that if God had legislated differently, it would have been right (e.g.) to murder, cheat, and torture, and that therefore morality is mutable in relation to divine legislation.
- Cudworth tries to refute these two aspects of Hobbes’s attack on the Scholastic position. 
- On the crucial points about the freedom of the will and the natural character of morality, he believes Aristotle is right and Hobbes is wrong. Hobbes’s errors reflect not only a mistaken approach to ethics, but also a mistaken approach to basic questions of epistemology and metaphysics. His position is a revival of the ‘Democritic doctrine’ that Cudworth sees in ancient atomism and empiricism. In Cudworth’s view, the ancient doctrine of Democritus and Epicurus, recently revived by Gassendi and Hobbes, rests on an indefensible metaphysics.
- He rejects three positions: (1) Hobbes’s version ofdeterminism andanti-rationalism; (2) theintellectualist position ofAquinas; (3) the voluntarist and libertarian conception of the will. On the first two points he agrees with Bramhall, but disagrees with him on the third, since Bramhall accepts the voluntarist claims that Cudworth criticizes. His criticisms of these three positions and his attempts to develop a fourth position are worth considering, even though it is not clear exactly what position he eventually maintains, or how it differs from the three positions he rejects.
- He rejects that the will and understanding are mutually exclusive; the will is not ‘blind’, as it would, if it would include no element of understanding. Both Scholastic views are wrong, in Cudworth’s view, because they treat the will and the understanding as though they were two distinct subjects (FW, ch. 7 = H 170–1). To speak of the understanding ‘propounding’ to the will, or ‘alluring’ or ‘inviting’ the will, and of the will as ‘following’ or ‘refusing to comply’ is to treat them as two distinct agents. But this treatment would be reasonable only if each of them were a real agent, and hence had both understanding and will. If we treat the will as an agent without understanding, we cannot fnid a satisfactory account of freedom. For if it is entirely blind, either it thoughtlessly follows understanding (as the pure intellectualist view claims) or it thoughtlessly and capriciously chooses to follow or not to follow understanding. In trying to explain intelligible choices by a real agent, who is a person with both understanding and will, we resort to unintelligible choices by a spurious agent, the blind will.  He rejects both:
    - The pure intellectualist view claims that the understanding alone determines the will. He rejects the pure intellectualist view as denying freewill.
    - A more complex view claims that the will ‘determines the understanding both to exercise, and specifciation of objects’. He rejects the more complex view for two reasons: (1) It is viciously circular, because it treats the will as ‘blind’ in itself; the will determines the understanding only insofar as the understanding presents something to it, so that it is really determined by the understanding.¹¹ (2) It does not safeguard freewill, because an undetermined but blind will would act capriciously and randomly, which is contrary to genuine freedom.¹² There must be both an action of the understanding going before every act of the will, and also an act of the will going before every act of the understanding, which is further contradictious and impossible.’
- He is rather hasty in assuming that indeterminism implies random and capricious motion that could not be a subject for praise and blame. The voluntarist might reply that when we choose the apparently greater good, we choose it because it appears greater, even though the causal connexion is not deterministic. We might fairly ask the voluntarist, however, why the non-deterministic character of the causal connexion is necessary for the choice to be free and responsible; on this point Cudworth has identified a reasonable objection to voluntarist indeterminism.
- Cudworth suggests that the intellectualist Scholastic view that the will is determined by the greater apparent good is a threat to freewill (FW, ch. 2 = H 158). But it is difficult to see how far he departs from the intellectualist position. After rejecting the ‘blind will’ presupposed by both intellectualism and voluntarism, he suggests that we need a different account of the first mover that underlies rational action. In his view, this first mover is the desire for happiness.¹⁸ This is not a desire for some specifci object such as pleasure, but a more general desire explaining our particular desires; we want the different particular goods we want on the assumption that they achieve happiness.¹⁹ This description of the desire for happiness captures the Aristotelian conception of a final good. This conception underlies Aquinas’ intellectualist account of the will. Hence it is difficult to see how Cudworth’s appeal to a desire for happiness marks a disagreement with intellectualism. Perhaps he rejects it by denying that the desire for happiness is always predominant; in that case he agrees with Scotus’ critique of eudaemonism. He seems to endorse the Scotist position in his description of the other powers of the soul. He mentions the concupiscible and irascible parts over which we have no ‘despotic’ power, but which the ‘hegemonicon’ may gradually control. Similarly, the hegemonicon may support or reject the demands of conscience.²⁰ Cudworth does not suggest that the hegemonicon necessarily follows either particular impulses or the desire for happiness or the demands of conscience. 
- What, then, is the hegemonicon? Cudworth takes it to be the ultimate basis of freedom and of praise and blame.²¹ He argues that it cannot be the Scholastic blind will, because it is indifferent and ‘fortuitously’ determines itself. But he acknowledges that it is guided by the appearance of good.²² Here he seems to refer to Aquinas’ account of the will rather than to Scotus’ account. He objects to the explanation of our capacity to choose the lesser good in the case where we choose between two objects that do not appear good in every respect. He suggests that in cases where x appears much better than y, but both x and y have some pros and cons, the will may nevertheless, according to the Scholastics, choose y because of the relatively small apparent good in it. Cudworth objects that this description of the blind will and ‘active indifference’ makes it no more than ‘active irrationality and nonsense’, and hence unsuitable to be the hegemonicon. In opposition to the Scholastic position, as he interprets it, Cudworth argues that the hegemonicon cannot be ‘utterly devoid of all light, and perception, or understanding’ (FW, ch. 9 = H 177). But he believes it cannot simply be reason, which is never mistaken; it must include the possibility of error, together with the possibility of directing one’s attention and of beginning and ending one’s deliberation.²⁴ These capacities in the hegemonicon explain why it is not simply a passive recipient of judgments of understanding.²⁵ Since we may make more or less effort to deliberate, and may deliberate more or less carefully, we may judge what is in fact worse to be better, and hence may make a culpable mistake; for it was in our power to deliberate more carefully.²⁶ The hegemonicon is fallible, and when it goes wrong it is responsible for a person’s choosing badly. This description explains why the hegemonicon is the source of freewill. Its good or bad deliberation about good and evil is the basis for praise and blame. But this is not because it possesses the liberty of indifference.²⁷ On the contrary: if our deliberation about the best thing to do did not determine our choice, but we had some natural and unpredictable tendency to choose the worse outcome for no reason when we were presented with the choice between it and the better outcome, we could not reasonably be praised or blamed for anything. The fact that we made the worse choice would just be something about us that we could not be expected to alter; for no deliberation about altering it would be effective. 
- Instead of trying to find responsibility in indifference, we should place it in the agent’s capacity to deliberate. This power to deliberate is inconsistent with the claim that everything is necessary.²⁸ Our use of this power determines whether we follow the dictates of conscience or the suggestions of other impulses.²⁹ Since we can choose to use our deliberative capacity well or badly, we can reasonably be blamed for the way we use it. 
- Cudworth’s major difference from Aquinas seems to be his rejection of the priority of the desire for happiness. In his view, the freedom of the will consists in its being bound neither by the desire for happiness nor by the demands of conscience. The hegemonicon considers the various aims that belong to us by nature—particular impulses, the desire for happiness, and concern for the honestum. Whereas Scotus identifies (at least sometimes) the freedom of the will with the affection for justice, Cudworth makes the hegemonicon superior to conscience as well as to self-love. 
- His conception of the hegemonicon makes it clear why he rejects Hobbes’s anti-rationalism as an account of the will and as an account of freedom. For the hegemonicon is the source of freedom precisely insofar as it differs from a Hobbesian will; it is not simply the last appetite in Hobbesian deliberation, but it is the refelctive and deliberative source of the comparative judgments that underlie rational action. 
- Cudworth effectively attacks Hobbes’s account of what free choice ought to consist in, from a compatibilist point of view. In Cudworth’s view, human action is free and responsible to the extent that it is determined by practical reason and deliberation picking out the action that seems better on the whole. He rejects the Hobbesian view that prudent, rational action is simply the product of the strongest desire. Hence Cudworth infers that, given a correct account of freewill and rational choice, the Hobbesian account of action implies that there is no freewill. Hobbes’s anti-rationalism about action and motivation raises a serious difficulty for human freedom, once we combine it with a plausible account of freewill. Hobbes conceals this difficulty only because he combines his anti-rationalist account of action with an account of freewill that is open to Cudworth’s objections.
- He does not place freedom in an arbitrary choice that is indifferent to the comparative value of different options. He ascribes this freedom of arbitrary choice both to human and to divine wills, but he does not take it to be the sort of freedom that supports praise and blame. He does not take God’s choices to result from the freewill that supports praise and blame; for the ways in which human choice goes beyond certain knowledge are alien to divine perfection.³⁴ God has liberty, but not freewill. Descartes’s doctrine of the creation of the eternal truths makes these truths the result of God’s arbitrary and contingent choice. Cudworth argues, on the contrary, that God’s liberty consists in acting in accordance with the nature of the goodness and wisdom that necessarily belong to God.³⁵ 
- Protagoras maintains that justice is determined by the law of a particular state, and Cudworth fnids this position both in the outlook of the ‘vulgar’ and in Hobbes.³⁶ Against this ‘positive’ view of morality he defends the Platonic view that morality is eternal and immutable. He believes that the Protagorean position opposed by Plato makes the same basic errors as those he finds in theological voluntarism. A positivist view makes morality ‘mutable’ because it implies that morality changes with the provisions of positive law in different places and times. The theological voluntarist tries to avoid this sort of mutability by treating morality as the unchanging commands of an eternal legislator. Hobbes accepts voluntarism by treating the laws of nature as the commands of God.³⁷
- Cudworth agrees with Suarez in defending moral properties that are eternal and immutable, in the sense that they are not subject to change either by human legislation or by the unqualifeid power of God.
- Hebelievesthat the arguments inspired by Suarez support Plato’s rejection of a positive and legislative conception of morality.
- In attacking the theological as well as the legal conception of morality, Cudworth clarifeis his views on eternity and immutability. If God has commanded these laws from eternity, and always will command them, morality is apparently eternal, and no more subject to change than any laws of nature that God decides not to change. But this sort of eternality and immutability does not satisfy Cudworth.⁴⁴ Theological voluntarism ensures only that morality is unchanging, not that it is immutable; if it is to be immutable, it must be immune to changes in some counterfactual circumstances as well as in the actual world. The positivist and the theological moralist must agree that if the legislator changed his mind, right and wrong would change too. If it is necessarily true that good is what ought to be chosen by a rational agent, and that the right is what is required by impartial reason, good and right are mutable in relation to these other properties. If they were not mutable even to this extent, they would be absolutely simple.⁴⁵ Cudworth, however, does not seem to affirm their absolute simplicity. If he believed that the nature of a cube is immutable in relation to everything, he would infer that it would not change even if the nature of sides and right angles changed; but he does not infer this.
- obscurity about naturalism does not affect his main objection to legislative theories of morality; for naturalist and non-naturalist theories of intrinsic morality agree that morality is non-legislative. Legislative theories take moral properties to be mutable in relation to legislative acts, whereas, in Cudworth’s view, moral properties are not mutable in this respect. The legislative theory is no more plausible, he suggests, than the claim that we can decide that a triangle will no longer have three sides. Since the nature of a triangle is not mutable in relation to legislative acts, we have no reason to suppose that moral properties are mutable in relation to legislative acts.⁴⁹
- even in caseswherelegislation makesan action right orwrong, legislation alone does not create right and wrong. If it is wrong for me to drive on the left in the USA, then (1) the legislator has prohibited it, and (2) it is right to obey the legislator.⁵¹ The second condition depends on what is right in itself, apart from any legislation. The rightness of obedience cannot itself be the result of legislation or command; for if the legislator commanded us to obey him, that command itself would have no moral authority unless it were already right to obey the legislator. Some aspects of right and wrong, therefore, are mutable in relation to legislation, because they presuppose the existence of immutable rightness and wrongness determining whether or not it is right to obey a legislator or this particular legislator. If something can become right by being legislated, something else is non-legislatively right and wrong. A purely legislative theory, therefore, is self-defeating.
- They therefore force Cudworth to make clear a point that Plato takes for granted in the Euthyphro. Cudworth’s argument against the legislative theory shows why Plato is entitled to insist on an explanatory property that is not in flux; unless we recognize such a property, we cannot explain why it is right to obey a command (for instance) in the cases where it is right.
- Cudworth’s examination of legislative accounts makes clear a difficulty in any reductive account of moral properties that identifeis them with non-moral properties—those that can be applied without raising any further questions requiring moral assessment.
- Cudworth attacks Hobbes’s legislative theory by presenting Hobbes with what we may call an ‘open question’. But he does not rely on a purely semantic open question such as we fnid in Price and Moore.⁶² He does not argue that we can doubt without explicit self-contradiction whether what a stronger party commands is right. He claims to fnid an open moral question; for he argues that we have good moral reasons for regarding some further property as the proper basis for our judgment that a command is right. To see whether this is so, it is not enough to consult our linguistic intuitions about what is trivial, nearly tautologous, or self-contradictory; these tell us only whether we have found an open semantic question. To identify an open moral question, we need to rely on our moral judgment, to see whether we seem to have some reasonable basis for judgment in specific counterfactual circumstances (e.g., where the party giving the commands has no legitimate authority): Cudworth argues, then, that Hobbesian sufficient conditions for placing us under a moral obligation do not close the question about whether we really are morally obliged. If Hobbes says that rightness consists in being legislated, we can raise a reasonable question about whether a particular legislator legislates rightly. If we try to answer this question by appeal to a further legislator, we face a vicious regress. Hence we must recognize some non-legislative standard of rightness. It is right to obey a commander only if the commander has a moral right to obedience; this further question is not settled by the fact that the commander issued a command. 
- Moral properties are mutable only in relation to the nature of things, not in relation to anyone’s judgments or beliefs or desires. To make them mutable in relation to anything other than the nature of things is to fail to explain what makes actions right and wrong. 
- To say that moral rightness consists in being willed by God is to make it mutable in relation to the will of God. But we can see that it is not mutable in this respect. For if nothing about the nature of things were different, but the will of God were different from what it is, God would will what is wrong rather than what is right. If God were to will injustice and hatred rather than justice and love, and nothing were different about the nature of human beings and their environment, God would will wrong actions rather than right ones. Since we can recognize that what God willed in these conditions would be wrong, we can see that being right does not consist in being willed by God. 
- Cudworth’s argument does not show that voluntarists are inconsistent if they simply deny his counterfactual supposition and affrim that if God willed something different, that would be right. Ockham sometimes expresses this view.⁶³ If Cudworth objects that this voluntarist position fails to capture the explanation that we provide by appeal to rightness, voluntarists might reply that rightness does not provide the sort of explanation he supposes; it does not really mention the aspect of the nature of things that makes an act of will right or wrong. This voluntarist reply to Cudworth rejects some intuitive beliefs about rightness and its explanatory role, in order to maintain a basic principle about divine freedom and sovereignty. It thereby treats metaphysical and theological claims as absolutely fundamental in relation to moral claims, so that it first fixes the metaphysical and theological basis and then accepts or rejects moral claims that do or do not fit this basis. In accepting this hierarchy, it affirms a foundationalist rather than a holist account of morality and metaphysics. Cudworth’s view, on the contrary, might be defended as an expression of a holist attitude to morality and metaphysics. In his view, meta-ethics ought to respect those intuitive beliefs about morality and about the explanatory role of moral properties that a voluntarist view has to override.  Cudworth objects that we can recognize the difference between a command’s being backed by overwhelming force and its being morally justifeid, and that in the frist case we do not think it necessarily includes moral obligation. A defender of Hobbes might answer that though we think we see this difference, there really is no difference. To take this view is to reject the intuitive beliefs that make the difference clear to us in the cases that Cudworth describes. From Cudworth’s point of view, the Hobbesian position is bound to be mistaken about what makes it right, when it is right, to obey the commands of an authority. 
- In opposition to Hobbes, Cudworth maintains a position much closer to intellectualism in moral psychology and to naturalism in moral theory. Though we have seen that he claims to reject Scholastic views of the will, his own position is quite close to Scholastic intellectualism. His moral doctrine is even closer to Scholastic naturalism. He maintains that the obligations of eternal and immutable morality are not the products of divine will. 
- Cudworth accepts the naturalist side of Suarez’s position: According to Suarez’s ‘intermediate’ position (as Suarez describes it), some aspects of natural law are independent of the divine legislative will and some depend on it. Natural law is law, and imposes an obligation, insofar as it depends on the divine will, whereas the rightness and wrongness of the acts that it prescribes and prohibits are features of the nature of things in themselves, apart from the divine will. Emphasis on one side or another of Suarez’s position results in a more strongly voluntarist or naturalist account. It is clearer that Cudworth goes beyond Suarez on this point, and reverts to Vasquez’s view that obligation, as well as duty, belongs to nature and not primarily to will.
- Cudworth’s Eternal and Immutable Morality was not published until 1731, 26 years after Clarke’s Boyle Lectures. None of the major moralists before Price seems to have read Cudworth’s book; Price acknowledges it generously.² Cudworth’s arguments are not adequately refelcted in More’s Enchiridion Ethicum.
- Clarke’s idea of intrinsic morality may be defended by appeal to Cudworth’s demand for eternal and immutable morality. If the rightness of sparing the life of an innocent person is immutable, it belongs to the action simply insofar as it is sparing the life of an innocent person. If it depended on some further facts about the agent or the beneficiary of the action, it could change from being right to wrong if these further facts changed; hence its rightness would not be immutable. If it is to be immutably right, the mere fact that it is sparing the life of an innocent person must be the sole and sufficient basis of its rightness. Though Cudworth does not connect immutability with the intrinsic character of an action in exactly Clarke’s terms, Clarke might intelligibly claim to capture Cudworth’s implicit position. 
- Cudworth stands between Suarez and Clarke on these issues. He does not speak of ftiness as they do, and so he does not make it clear whether he takes the immutability of morality to require the strong immutability demanded by Clarke or the more qualifeid immutability allowed by Suarez. 
- Cudworth rejects the view that (1) the true principles of justice are those commanded by the sovereign, and (2) are true because they are commanded by the sovereign.





#                  Difficulties

- Cudworth is mistaken, therefore, if he believes that recognition of freedom of specification and of exercise precludes an intellectualist account of the will. We reject intellectualism only if we take the will to be undetermined even by the last act of judgment,¹⁴ so that in the same circumstances the will is capable of going in different directions.¹⁵
- He rejects determinism, if this is understood as the doctrine that everything is necessitated by previous events; he takes Buridan’s ass to show the presence of contingency in some choices (FW, ch. = H 164). He does not believe, however, that voluntary and responsible action is to be identified with this sort of contingency (FW, ch. 5 = H 166). Sometimes he suggests that we are responsible for an error if further consideration would have caused us to avoid the error by better judgment (FW, ch. 10 = H 179). He adds, however, that this further consideration must also be possible for us, and that this possibility requires the absence of determination by ‘antecedent necessary causes'. It is difficult to say how strongly or how consistently Cudworth believes that freedom from the necessity of nature requires the absence of determination. 
- If our description of Aquinas’ view was right, Cudworth’s view differs far less from Aquinas’ actual view than from the positions that Cudworth ascribes to the Scholastics. In particular, Aquinas’ explanation of the non-necessity of deliberation and election does not seem to rely on the sort of indifference that Cudworth attacks as irrational. When Aquinas argues that it is possible for us to ‘consider’ the different aspects of good and bad in different options, he seems to mean what Cudworth means in saying that we are not merely ‘passive to our own practical judgments’, but contribute something to their character (FW, ch. 10 = H 179). Aquinas believes that our will influences our consideration of one or another aspect of a situation, but he does not suggest that this influence of the will is altogether independent of our judgment about what it would be best to consider. In fact, he agrees with Aquinas in believing that one can attribute some sort of indeterminacy to deliberation and election without taking the will to be altogether independent of beliefs about better and worse. 
- How, then, does the hegemonicon estimate the claims of conscience and of self-love, and how does it choose between them? This question seems to face Cudworth no less than it faces Butler; for both of them seem to take conscience to be (in Butler’s words) superior to self-love, but they do not take superiority to imply that we necessarily prefer the demands of conscience over those of self-love. Cudworth does not want to conclude that the hegemonicon prefers self-love or conscience for no reason; that would be a return to ‘active irrationality and nonsense’, which he tries to avoid in denying indifference to the will. But apparently it cannot decide on the basis of self-love or of conscience, if it is capable of deciding between the two. To resolve this difficulty, Cudworth might try to distinguish two aspects of conscience (Though his account of freewill is suggestive, he does not develop it far enough to make it clear how he intends to answer the questions that can reasonably be raised about it.): 
    - It takes an impartial point of view, standing outside the desire for one’s own happiness, and considering the value of pursuing one’s own interest in comparison with other values. If we consider the first aspect of conscience we might claim that it captures the point of view of the hegemonicon, because we are capable of looking at practical questions from a broader view than the view of self-love. To this degree we might identify the outlook of the hegemonicon with the outlook of conscience. But since our taking this point of view need not lead us to endorse the requirements of morality, we may still separate the outlook of the hegemonicon from the honestum. But though this Butlerian solution offers a reasonable account of the deliberative standpoint of the hegemonicon, Cudworth does not present it.  
    - It endorses the specifci principles prescribed by morality, embodying the honestum.
- It is more diffciult to see why Cudworth rejects Hobbes’s determinism; for his description of the hegemonicon and of the source of freedom does not seem to confilct with determinism.
- It is difficult to decide where Cudworth disagrees with Hobbes, because neither of them clearly distinguishes two claims: (1) Every event is necessitated by antecedent events, i.e., for every event there is some antecedent event that is causally suffciient for it. (2) Every event is necessary, i.e., it is not possible for it not to happen. Hobbes seems to confuse the two claims in saying that ‘every suffciient cause is a necessary cause’ (discussed by Cudworth in ch. 22 = H 203). If he just means that every sufficient condition necessitates its effect, this is an analytic truth. If he means that every sufficient condition is a condition that could not possibly not have obtained, and that therefore its effect could not possibly have not obtained, this does not follow from the definition of a sufficient condition. 
- Though he defends that rightness of an action is immutable, his position is obscure about whether rightness is free from the relation to happiness
- Cudworth does not consider the distinction suggested by Suarez, between obligations created by commands and non-obligatory duties prior to commands. Suarez’s position allows us to agree with Hobbes’s view that the expression of the will of a superior, embodied in a command, introduces a distinctive type of moral requirement. We might agree with Hobbes this far, and still agree with Cudworth’s argument to show that some moral requirement precedes any obligation generated by a command.
- In Hobbes’s view, however, Cudworth is wrong about the difference between a nonobligatory and an obligatory command. According to Hobbes, a command imposes an obligation if and only if the commander creates a sufficient motive. He creates the motive if he can attach a credible threat of punishment for violation of the command. Hence Hobbes can distinguish obligatory from non-obligatory commands without conceding that if a command imposes an obligation, obedience to the commander must be right. 
- The claim that our obligation to obey commands rests on a non-moral basis raises a possibility that Cudworth does not properly take into account. Cudworth is less careful than Suarez, since he assumes, with Vasquez, that the moral basis for obeying an obligation must itself be an obligation. Suarez rejects this assumption; he agrees with Hobbes to the extent of holding a legal and imperative conception of obligation, but he recognizes a non-obligatory basis in intrinsic right and wrong. Culverwell suggests a modification of Suarez’s position, suggesting that obligation rests on some intrinsic basis, but a non-moral basis.⁵⁹ Hobbes and the theological voluntarist exploit this possibility. We avoid an infinite regress of obligations and commands if we recognize an intrinsic (in Suarez’s sense), but non-moral, reason for accepting an obligation. But this voluntarist answer does not defeat Cudworth’s main point.
