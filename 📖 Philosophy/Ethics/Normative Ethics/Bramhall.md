- Bramhall is an incompatibilist and indeterminist, since he believes in acts of freewill that cannot be parts of sequences of necessitating causes (i.e., sequences in which the earlier member is in each case suffciient for the later). For Bramhall, free agent is ‘that, which, when all things are present which are needful to produce the effect, can nevertheless not produce it’
- Bramhall is a voluntarist (the will is not determined by the greatest good and will is not just passion). Bramhall rejects Aquinas’ intellectualism (the view that the will is determined by the greater good presented by reason). He assumes that intellectualism is incompatible with rationalism, because intellectualists reduce the will to a passion, by taking it to be determined by the greater apparent good. In his view, then, the difference between will and passion matters because the will has to be free of all determination. 
- Bramhall is a rationalist (the will is not determined by the strongest passion)
- He assumes that rationalism requires indeterminism.
- He is an indeterminist because he is a voluntarist; he appeals to the possibility of choosing the lesser good when one knows the greater good. He assumes that if the will is free from necessitation by passions, it is free from causal necessitation altogether. 
- He contrasts spontaneous agents with rational and deliberative agents, and claims that only the latter are free.
- He rejects:
    - Hobbes’s version ofdeterminism andanti-rationalism;
    - the intellectualist position ofAquinas;
