- Maxwell protests against the view that egoism is the only safe alternative to enthusiasm. 
- He is Cumberland’s translator and editor
- Maxwell rejects non-normative accounts of goodness that do not make it clear that goodness deserves to be chosen and is a worthy object of pleasure.³⁷ For similar reasons he finds an account of goodness as ‘convenience’ unsatisfactory. He takes ‘convenience’ to refer only to the non-moral good, as Cumberland understands it, and he finds this inadequate to capture moral goodness.³⁸ If we combine an account of goodness as convenience with a eudaemonist conception of morality, we do not capture the essential features of moral obligation. 
- Cumberland’s view, according to Maxwell, overlooks the regulative role of morality in relation to the public good. It is morally permissible to pursue the public good only insofar as it does not violate morality.⁴² If promotion of the public good requires injustice, for instance, it is open to moral objection; hence moral requirements are not exhausted by the requirement to pursue the public good.
- He attributes a non-instrumental notion of convenience, understood as appropriateness for a rational agent, from the Stoics.⁴³ In applying the Stoic doctrine to his own views about goodness, Maxwell implicitly acknowledges that an action may be ‘convenient’ to rational agents because it is suitable to their nature, without being purely instrumental ‘because of the necessity of their affairs’.⁴⁴
- Maxwell believes that Cumberland demotes morality to instrumental prudence by subor-dinating it to the pursuit of the non-moral good; Cumberland does not see that morality deserves to be chosen for its own sake, and carries an obligation within itself. Hence, according to Maxwell, Cumberland overlooks the obligation that belongs to morality in its own right, apart from any sanction that God attaches to it.⁴⁵ According to Cumberland, the fact that virtue is a part of happiness is a sanction attached to virtue by a legislator. Maxwell takes this view to assume the character of virtue itself is distinct from the aspect of virtue that promotes happiness; otherwise that aspect of it could not be the result of ‘attachment’.
He objects that virtue must be right and obligatory independently of the sanction if the sanction is rightly ‘attached’ to it. 
- This argument does not exactly capture Cumberland’s view. According to Cumberland, the goodness of virtue is a sanction, even if it is essential to virtue; even if virtue promotes happiness simply by being good in itself, its promotion of happiness is a sanction. Hence the moral goodness of virtue need not be separate from the attached sanction.
But this reply to Maxwell reveals the basic difficulty in Cumberland’s claims about sanctions. If the goodness of virtue is essential to it, because of its relation to the nature of rational agents, how can it have been ‘attached’ to virtue as a sanction? We cannot attach a key to a chain unless the key and the chain already exist; we do not attach trilaterality to a triangle. To recognize the inherent goodness of virtue is to recognize that this is essential to the nature of the agents whom God has created. One cannot legitimately treat such features as having been attached to the creation.
Might we reply on behalf of Cumberland that his remarks about ‘attachment’ are misleading, but the substance of his position is reasonable? Perhaps his claim that God ‘attached’ certain properties to virtue just means that he created human beings in such a way that these states of character would be both good for others and good for the virtuous agent. In that case the sanction might be treated as an essential part of virtue and human nature, not something externally attached as a chain is attached to a key.
But if we say this in support of Cumberland, we raise a more basic question about his appeals to divine legislation. As Suarez points out, claims about natural law and the will of God need to distinguish the creative from the legislative will of God. The fact that there are human beings, creatures for whom justice and benevolence are good, depends on God’s will as creator; and if morality depends on human nature, the fact that these actions are morally required depends on God’s having created rational animals rather than limiting the creation to plants and non-rational animals. But these facts do not show that morality depends on God’s legislative will; for since facts about creation are facts about created nature, they are facts about how things are in their own right, apart from any further legislative act of God.
- Exploration of Maxwell’s objections, therefore, reveals a serious difficulty in Cumberland’s position. Maxwell claims that since morality is good and obligatory in itself, it possesses its goodness and its obligatory character independently of the sanction attached by divine legislation. He may have misunderstood Cumberland’s broad use of ‘sanction’ and ‘attach’. But if we allow Cumberland a broad enough use of these terms to answer Maxwell, we also cast doubt on Cumberland’s claims about the extent of divine legislation in morality. For a broad use of ‘sanction’ includes non-legislative ‘sanctions’ that come from God as creator; the presence of these sanctions does not show that morality depends on divine legislation. 
- Maxwell believes that we can avoid this fault in Cumberland’s position only if we recognize a moral obligation—antecedent to any divine commands—to obey divine commands. Hence, in Maxwell’s view, we must abandon Cumberland’s voluntarism.
- In Maxwell’s view the voluntarist position conflicts with the facts about the honestum.⁶⁰ He rejects the voluntarist claim that legislation can make something genuinely honestum. His argument seems to be this: (1) The honestum is good in its own right and because of its own nature. (2) If legislation is the sole source of the honestum, it must make some actions good in their own right. (3) But if something is good in its own right, it is good independently of being commanded or legislated. (3) Legislation cannot make something good independently of being legislated. (4) Hence legislation cannot be the sole source of the honestum.
- Since he rejects Cumberland’s voluntarism, Maxwell also rejects his explanation of the immutability of the natural law.⁶¹ If natural law depended on divine legislation, it could be changed by a change in divine legislation, whether or not divine legislation will in fact change. If we make natural law depend on divine law in this way, we reverse their proper order; for the legitimacy of divine legislation presupposes an independent natural law giving God the right to legislate.
- He agrees with Shaftesbury’s efforts to defend the disinterested love of God without endorsing any harmful and irrational ‘enthusiasm’.⁶³ In his view, we can maintain this position only if we recognize moral rightness independent of divine legislation.
- Maxwell concludes that we can maintain the legitimacy and authority of divine legislation only if we accept a naturalist view of natural law.⁶⁵ He agrees with the position of Vasquez and (apparently) of Cudworth, who take natural law and its obligation to precede any divine command
