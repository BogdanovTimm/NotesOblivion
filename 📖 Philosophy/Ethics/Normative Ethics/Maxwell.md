- Maxwell protests against the view that egoism is the only safe alternative to enthusiasm. 
- He is Cumberland’s translator and editor
- Maxwell rejects non-normative accounts of goodness that do not make it clear that goodness deserves to be chosen and is a worthy object of pleasure.³⁷ For similar reasons he finds an account of goodness as ‘convenience’ unsatisfactory. He takes ‘convenience’ to refer only to the non-moral good, as Cumberland understands it, and he finds this inadequate to capture moral goodness.³⁸ If we combine an account of goodness as convenience with a eudaemonist conception of morality, we do not capture the essential features of moral obligation. 
- Cumberland’s view, according to Maxwell, overlooks the regulative role of morality in relation to the public good. It is morally permissible to pursue the public good only insofar as it does not violate morality.⁴² If promotion of the public good requires injustice, for instance, it is open to moral objection; hence moral requirements are not exhausted by the requirement to pursue the public good.
