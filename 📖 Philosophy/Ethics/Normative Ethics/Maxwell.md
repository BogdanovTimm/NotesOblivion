- Maxwell protests against the view that egoism is the only safe alternative to enthusiasm. 
- He is Cumberland’s translator and editor
- Maxwell rejects non-normative accounts of goodness that do not make it clear that goodness deserves to be chosen and is a worthy object of pleasure.³⁷ For similar reasons he finds an account of goodness as ‘convenience’ unsatisfactory. He takes ‘convenience’ to refer only to the non-moral good, as Cumberland understands it, and he finds this inadequate to capture moral goodness.³⁸ If we combine an account of goodness as convenience with a eudaemonist conception of morality, we do not capture the essential features of moral obligation. 
- Cumberland’s view, according to Maxwell, overlooks the regulative role of morality in relation to the public good. It is morally permissible to pursue the public good only insofar as it does not violate morality.⁴² If promotion of the public good requires injustice, for instance, it is open to moral objection; hence moral requirements are not exhausted by the requirement to pursue the public good.
- He attributes a non-instrumental notion of convenience, understood as appropriateness for a rational agent, from the Stoics.⁴³ In applying the Stoic doctrine to his own views about goodness, Maxwell implicitly acknowledges that an action may be ‘convenient’ to rational agents because it is suitable to their nature, without being purely instrumental ‘because of the necessity of their affairs’.⁴⁴
- Maxwell believes that Cumberland demotes morality to instrumental prudence by subor-dinating it to the pursuit of the non-moral good; Cumberland does not see that morality deserves to be chosen for its own sake, and carries an obligation within itself. Hence, according to Maxwell, Cumberland overlooks the obligation that belongs to morality in its own right, apart from any sanction that God attaches to it.⁴⁵ According to Cumberland, the fact that virtue is a part of happiness is a sanction attached to virtue by a legislator. Maxwell takes this view to assume the character of virtue itself is distinct from the aspect of virtue that promotes happiness; otherwise that aspect of it could not be the result of ‘attachment’.
He objects that virtue must be right and obligatory independently of the sanction if the sanction is rightly ‘attached’ to it.
