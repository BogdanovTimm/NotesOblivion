- Thesameobjectionfaceslaternon-cognitivistswhoacceptboth Moore’s Open Question Argument and internalism about moral judgments and motivation.
Moore’s argument relies on apparent conceivability to settle possibility, whereas internalism relies on impossibility to dismiss apparent conceivability. If we ought to rely on the Open Question Argument, we ought to reject internalism; if we ought to accept internalism, we ought to reject the Open Question Argument. This objection is particularly serious for Hare, who relies on internalism to explain the success of Moore’s argument.
