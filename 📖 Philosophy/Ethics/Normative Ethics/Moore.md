- Moral terms can't be reduced to non-moral ones
- This distinction is quite alien to Plato, who takes the right answer to his question ‘What is the F itself that Fs have in common?’ to be exactly what makes F things F, or that ‘by which’ F things are F. While Ross assumes that properties match concepts, Plato does not. Ross, following Moore, distinguishes:
    - Property of rightness itself - 'What is the F itself that Fs have in common?’.
    - Right-making property - what makes F things F, or that ‘by which’ F things are F. It may be something other than F. For example, if F is rightness, then maximization of utility may be Right-making property of F

- The same objection faces later non-cognitivists who accept both Moore’s Open Question Argument and internalism about moral judgments and motivation.
Moore’s argument relies on apparent conceivability to settle possibility, whereas internalism relies on impossibility to dismiss apparent conceivability. If we ought to rely on the Open Question Argument, we ought to reject internalism; if we ought to accept internalism, we ought to reject the Open Question Argument. This objection is particularly serious for Hare, who relies on internalism to explain the success of Moore’s argument.
