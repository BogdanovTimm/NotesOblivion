- Natural Law is independent from the Devine Will
- Decalogue embodies Natural Low
- Decalogue do not allow dispensations
- 2 types of law:
    - lex - depends on the will of legislator
    - ius (right) - not depends on anyone's will
- Natural Law is a ius type of law
- There is a Natural Law (lex), properly so called, apart from the legislative will of God and this Natural Law imposes a genuine obligation apart from God’s command
- Vasquez take natural law and its obligation to precede any divine command
- The relevant deontic concepts—right, wrong, duty, and so on—presuppose some reference to a norm and a law. One might agree with this claim, but still deny that moral properties require legislation; that is why Vasquez, for instance, asserts that not every ius is a lex.
