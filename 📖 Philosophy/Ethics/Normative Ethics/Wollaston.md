- Though Clarke does not go as far as Wollaston goes in dismissing claims about human nature, Wollaston captures some of the spirit and motivation of Clarkeâ€™s account of eternal and immutable morality. Clarke differs from Cudworth and Suarez in avoiding any essential appeal to judgments about human nature and the human good. He wants moral judgments to be certain and evident apart from the uncertain support (as Wollaston suggests) of judgments about nature.
