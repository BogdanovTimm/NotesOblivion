- The Naturalism is true. Human functionis to be guided by practical reason
- An indeterminist doctrine of responsibility fits the doctrine of Christian predestination
- Natural Law involves a divine command.
- Suarez takes Ockham to hold that no action is bad except in so far as it is prohibited by God, and no action could not become good if it were prescribed by God, and conversely. 
- We can keep the God's Low in the state of sin, because togethere with the love of God, there may be selfish motives for action
- Tries to stay with Aquinas
- Natural Law contains both prescriptions and moral facts
- There are 2 version of Naturalism:
    - Objective Naturalism - someone's nature says what is good about someone. Suarez says that Vasquez holds this 
    - Cognitive Naturalism - someone2's jusgement about someone1's objective nature says what is good about for someone1. Suarez says that Aquinas holds this
- Suarez rejects Aquinas' view on a Natursl Law because it is too broad
- Suarez rejects Vasquez'es view on a Natural Law, because Law does require legislator
- Natural Law requires that God legislate it
- God is not obligeted to do anything, because an obligation requires someone to impose that obligation.
- Suarez does not imply that without an imposed obligation we have no sufficient moral reason for observing the principles of the Natural Law. God’s imposition gives us a further reason, but not the only reason, for observing these principles. This further reason essentially depends on God’s expressing the will for us to observe these principles, not on our recognizing that God believes we ought to observe them. Hence natural law requires more than God’s intellectual affirmation of the principles of natural law.
- According to Suarez, ‘obliging’ is the name for the act of introducing a moral necessity by expressing one’s will. The only agent who can introduce such a necessity is an agent who is entitled to introduce it, because he has the appropriate authority. Such an agent introduces the necessity by issuing a command. That is why obligation requires a command by a legitimate authority. 
- His claims about obligation constitute an analysis of a narrow concept of obligation, and do not imply that all moral requirements involve an imposed necessity. 
- Natural Law requires both:
    - Intrincic moral rightness that is based on the nature
    - Divine command - adds moral obligation
- He recognizes both:
    - natural goodness
    - intrinsic morality
- Types of good:
    - Non-moral:
        - pleasant
        - useful
    - Moral:
        - right
- Suarez accepts both Aquinas’ eudaemonism and his naturalism about the morally good.
- In his metaphysics, Suarez opposes voluntarism about essences. They do not depend on God as creator 
- Just as God could not choose to create round squares, God could not choose to create any other inconsistent combinations. 
- It is necessarily true that God knows them, and so it is not possible for them to be true without God’s knowing them;
still, the counterfactual claim is true that even if God were not to know them, they would be true. 
- While it is up to God to create human beings or not, it is not up to God to make the human essence inconsistent, as the essences of chimaera and of round square are, or to make inconsistent essences consistent. In order to create human beings and make their good something different from what it is, God would have had to make inconsistent things consistent. On this point Suarez is a naturalist.
- an intrinsically wrong action would still be a sin (peccatum) even if God did not prohibit it; hence neither sin nor blameworthiness (culpa) depends on divine prohibition. Both sin and blameworthiness follow from the fact that a voluntary act is contrary to right reason. In that case, therefore, the bad action would be a sin and a fault morally, but not theologically, or as directed towards God.
- He thinks Aquinas takes that God can't not prescribe Natural Law not only with his Ordered Power, but also with his Absolute Power
- God is free not to create us. If God didn't created us - there would be no Natural Law. But when he created us - automatically there are Natural Law that we have now. God can't impose Law that isn't in accordance with our nature 
- Similarly to Aquinas, Suarez think that there are higher and subordinate principles of Natural Law
- Same action can't be sometimes good in itself and sometimes bad in itself
- We may speak consciously ambiguitly if that is morally justifiably
- God is not free to dispense us from obedience to them, because God prescribes us to obey Natural Law, rather than to obey to his Positive Law. Suarez therefore rejects Scotus’ treatment of dispensations.
- He believes that the obligation imposed by the natural law requires a command expressing God’s legislative will, but he intends this point to clarify his strict concepts of law and obligation. Though he disagrees with Aquinas on this point, he accepts the further claims of Aquinas that Scotus and Ockham oppose. He claims that actions are intrinsically right and wrong, and hence are the source of duties, apart from any divine command; God necessarily prescribes and forbids these actions because they are intrinsically right and wrong. Suarez denies, therefore, that morality depends on divine commands.
- Law of Nations consists of:
    - Law of particular Nations
    - Law of communications of Nations (including laws of war) 
- Law of Nations are not part of Natural Law, hence Law of Nations are not prescribe what is good in itself
- To do what Law of Nations prescribes is intrinsically right in that sense that it is intrinsically right to drive on one side of a road. Thought it is non-intrinsically right to drive on the left or the right side of the road, you must create a law about on which side to drive
- Since Suarez regards the state as essentially aiming at the public good, he argues that it is legitimate for the community to depose a ruler who acts against the public good. A law professing to authorize a ruler to do what he likes, even against the public good, would not meet the conditions of Leg. i 6 for being a genuine law, and so citizens could not be obliged to obey it.
- Suarez allows defensive war to prevent our being victims of aggression. He also allows aggressive war (1.6), in cases where we are not being attacked by another, in order to punish another state for infliction of an injury, if the other state is not willing to give just satisfaction for the injury (4.5).
In these grounds for war Suarez gives no permission for pre-emptive strikes against an enemy. 
- Suarez even defends rebellion and tyrannicide in some circumstances. 
- In the case of conquest through a just war, the subject people are required (tenetur) to obey their new ruler
- One might expect Suarez to argue that, since the original legislative power belongs to the political community as a whole, and not to any specific government, the government is simply an agent or delegate of the community, and therefore subject to dismissal at the discretion of the people. Suarez, however, denies that all legislative power is delegated by the people. He argues that the community can give away its legislative power to a government, so that the government is not necessarily bound by its own laws, and does not need to seek the continued approval of the community. In such a case the ruler has ‘ordinary’ power, and not merely ‘delegated’ power (4.9), and hence the ruler is entitled to delegate power to a subordinate without any special permission from the community.
On this point, Suarez rejects one element of democratic theory; he does not take the moral basis of political society and government to require a conception of legislative power as delegation. But his claims about the transfer of legislative power do not lead him to conclude that the common consent of the community becomes irrelevant once it has established a ruler with ordinary power. A hereditary ruler, for instance, inherits ordinary power together with the conditions on which the ordinary power was originally transferred (4.3).
A community cannot transfer legislative power unconditionally; hence it cannot irrevocably abandon any power to restrain or to replace its rulers. 
- Our discussion suggests that Suarez does not differ from Aquinas in any essential point about the nature and basis of morality. His disagreement about the role of divine commands in the natural law does not affect his view about the moral foundation of the natural law, and, in particular, does not lead him to maintain that morality depends on divine commands. In claiming that moral goodness is fixed by rational nature, he follows Aquinas’ naturalism.
Moreover, in claiming that we are rationally concerned about moral goodness because we aim at our ultimate end, and our ultimate end is realizing our rational nature, he accepts Aquinas’ combination of eudaemonism with naturalism. On these basic points, then, he is a traditional moralist, insofar as he stands in the tradition that includes Aquinas. The naturalist and eudaemonist aspects of his conception of goodness and rightness, as opposed to the voluntarist aspects of his conception of natural law, are the essential features of his theory of morality. 
- In moral philosophy, however, Suarez does not take natural law to be theoretically fundamental. His imperative conception of natural law as requiring divine commands is not intended to show that morality requires divine commands. He distinguishes morality, which is independent of divine commands, from natural law, which depends on them. He is not a ‘natural-law theorist’, if such a theorist gives theoretical priority to natural law in an account of morality. His elaborate discussion of natural law really has the opposite effect. For since he believes that natural law essentially depends on divine commands, and that moral right and wrong do not essentially depend on divine commands, he believes that moral right and wrong do not essentially depend on natural law, but are prior to it. He rejects the view, shared by Aquinas and Scotus, that natural law is essential to morality.
