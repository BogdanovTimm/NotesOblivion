- The Naturalism is true. Human functionis to be guided by practical reason
- An indeterminist doctrine of responsibility fits the doctrine of Christian predestination
- Natural Law involves a divine command.
- Suarez takes Ockham to hold that no action is bad except in so far as it is prohibited by God, and no action could not become good if it were prescribed by God, and conversely. 
- We can keep the God's Low in the state of sin, because togethere with the love of God, there may be selfish motives for action
- Tries to stay with Aquinas
- Natural Law contains both prescriptions and moral facts
- There are 2 version of Naturalism:
    - Objective Naturalism - someone's nature says what is good about someone. Suarez says that Vasquez holds this 
    - Cognitive Naturalism - someone2's jusgement about someone1's objective nature says what is good about for someone1. Suarez says that Aquinas holds this
- Suarez rejects Aquinas' view on a Natursl Law because it is too broad
- Suarez rejects Vasquez'es view on a Natural Law, because Law does require legislator
- Natural Law requires that God legislate it
- God is not obligeted to do anything, because an obligation requires someone to impose that obligation.
- Suarez does not imply that without an imposed obligation we have no sufficient moral reason for observing the principles of the Natural Law. God’s imposition gives us a further reason, but not the only reason, for observing these principles. This further reason essentially depends on God’s expressing the will for us to observe these principles, not on our recognizing that God believes we ought to observe them. Hence natural law requires more than God’s intellectual affirmation of the principles of natural law.
- According to Suarez, ‘obliging’ is the name for the act of introducing a moral necessity by expressing one’s will. The only agent who can introduce such a necessity is an agent who is entitled to introduce it, because he has the appropriate authority. Such an agent introduces the necessity by issuing a command. That is why obligation requires a command by a legitimate authority. 
- His claims about obligation constitute an analysis of a narrow concept of obligation, and do not imply that all moral requirements involve an imposed necessity. 
- Natural Law requires both:
    - Intrincic moral rightness that is based on the nature
    - Divine command - adds moral obligation
- He recognizes both:
    - natural goodness
    - intrinsic morality
- Types of good:
    - Non-moral:
        - pleasant
        - useful
    - Moral:
        - right
- Suarez accepts both Aquinas’ eudaemonism and his naturalism about the morally good.
- In his metaphysics, Suarez opposes voluntarism about essences. They do not depend on God as creator 
- Just as God could not choose to create round squares, God could not choose to create any other inconsistent combinations. 
- It is necessarily true that God knows them, and so it is not possible for them to be true without God’s knowing them;
still, the counterfactual claim is true that even if God were not to know them, they would be true.
