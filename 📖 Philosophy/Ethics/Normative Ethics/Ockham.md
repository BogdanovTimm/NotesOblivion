- Christianity conflicts with Greek ethics
- An indeterminist doctrine of responsibility fits the doctrine of Christian predestination
- Christian doctrine to require the decisive rejection of an Aristotelian framework
- Rejects Reciprocity of virtues
- argues that since Christians perform virtuous actions for the honour of God, their end in performing such actions is different from the end of a pagan who performs the same actions. Since different ends define different virtues, the virtues of pagans and of Christians differ specifically, not just numerically
- Voluntarism is true
- He allows dispensations that would give permission to violate a precept without revoking it. 
- Ockham has become notorious for holding views that, from a later philosophical perspective, have appeared to undermine the Aristotelian outlook that is expounded by Aquinas.
- He believes, for instance, that Aristotle’s rejection of Platonic Forms supports the metaphysical priority of the particular, and that the views of Aquinas and Scotus on universals concede too much to an un-Aristotelian Platonic realism
- Ockham agrees with Scotus’ view that Aquinas’ intellectualism and eudaemonism conflict with the freedom and contingency of human action. Since Aristotle insists on these features of human action, a plausible defence of Aristotle should, in Ockham’s view, reject Aquinas’ position. Similarly, Ockham gives Aristotelian reasons for rejecting Aquinas’ claims about virtue, practical reason, and prudence. 
- Ockham rejects eudaemonism, because he agrees with Scotus in believing that we do not necessarily will happiness









# Difficulties 

- He argues, for instance, that in some circumstances we might believe we cannot achieve happiness, and therefore might cease to will to be happy. Similarly, if we will not to exist, we thereby also will not to be happy. Since it is possible in these ways not to will happiness, we do not necessarily will happiness. But even if we think that happiness can't be achieved fully, we may think that we can get closer to it
