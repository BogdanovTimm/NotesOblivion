- He is natural law moralist
- Pufendorf attacks on appeals to natural desire for sociability 
- Morality depends on natural law, and hence on Divine commands, and that the natural foundation of morality consists in natural, but non-moral, goodness and badness.
- He critiques Hobbes
- the non-moral natural goods are simply those that promote one’s own advantage 
- the confusion creates spurious support for a legislative conception of morality.
- Even Hobbes, who goes furthest in a voluntarist direction, believes that what fits human nature is independent of God’s legislative will; that is why the laws of nature are counsels of self-preservation. But Hobbes does not believe that God commands obedience to these natural laws because they preserve human society; the commands are not an exercise of God’s benevolence or of God’s care for creation, but of God’s power. Culverwell, Locke, Cumberland, and Pufendorf reject this part of Hobbes’s view; they agree that in some way God necessarily chooses to command observance of the natural law that preserves human society. On this point they agree with Suarez. They differ from Suarez, and from one another, in their views about whether the element of natural law that is independent of command and will is also morality. None of them defends Suarez’s combination of naturalism (about right and wrong) and voluntarism (about obligation and law).
- He abandon Culverwell’s unsatisfactory compromise that we cannot recognise intrinsic rightness without recognising a requirement (debitum). He prefers a more thoroughly voluntarist position that rejects intrinsic rightness. 
- without a divine command some courses of action are unreasonable, and others are rationally appropriate, but no action is morally right or wrong because none is obligatory
- Hobbes, Cumberland, and Pufendorf all reject intrinsic rightness. Pufendorf rejects the naturalist position that he ascribes to Grotius. He rejects intrinsic rightness, and claims that whatever is right is right only because it is imposed by divine command. On this point he agrees with Cumberland (whom he cites). But he departs further than Cumberland departs from Grotius and the Scholastic position, by rejecting Grotius’ use of natural sociality as a basis for the evaluation of political society. In rejecting these two elements of Grotius’ position Pufendorf comes closer to Hobbes’s view. He disagrees with Hobbes in believing that moral rightness is irreducible to advantage, and therefore is imposed by divine law. But he follows Hobbes in denying that natural properties include any intrinsic moral rightness that is irreducible to advantage.
- Pufendorf also agrees with Hobbes in rejecting Grotius’ belief in natural sociality as the basis of a commonwealth. To show that the only legitimate moral demand on a commonwealth is the requirement to preserve peace, and that we need a commonwealth in order to preserve peace, he disagrees with Aristotle, the Stoics, the Scholastics, and Grotius. According to these defenders of natural sociality, facts about human nature itself, and not simply about competition, aggression, and self-preservation, make political life appropriate for human beings.
- Pufendorf affrims voluntarism as part of his argument about ‘the certainty of the disciplines that deal with morals’ ( JNG i 2).² He rejects the view of (allegedly) most of his predecessors, who are misled by Aristotle into believing that moral science is necessarily uncertain. In his view, it is capable of demonstration.³ Moral entities are imposed by God, but we do not rely on any special revelation of the divine will to know about them.⁴ Natural law is natural in the epistemological sense, since we know its requirements innately. But it is not natural in the metaphysical sense; it consists essentially in divine commands, not in facts about our nature. The certainty of moral principles is secured by the fact that they are imposed by a wise and benevolent God in view of the needs resulting from the human condition.⁵ In this statement of his position Pufendorf does not simply affirm that the natural law depends on the legislative will of God. On this issue Suarez and Pufendorf agree against the naturalist view of Vasquez (perhaps followed by Grotius). Suarez believes that the aspect of the natural law that creates ‘obligation’ (as Suarez understands it) depends on divine commands. Pufendorf’s denial of any right and wrong independent of God’s legislative will goes further than Suarez goes in the direction of voluntarism; he rejects Suarez’s and Grotius’ belief in intrinsic rightness and wrongness (honestas and turpitudo) apart from any imposition.
- Suarez derives morality from natural goodness and badness, so that rightness and wrongness are properties of actions promoting or harming the common good of rational agents. Suarez, therefore, takes divine commands to be necessary for natural law, but not for moral rightness. Pufendorf takes them to be necessary for moral rightness as well. 
- Some of Pufendorf’s arguments, however, go beyond the claim that creation implies dependence on the divine will. He allows that some properties belong to nature apart from divine ‘imposition’, and argues that moral properties are not among them. The properties that he takes not to be imposed are the result of creation; hence imposition implies some further act of the divine will beyond creation. Here he recognizes the distinction between creation and legislation, even though he overlooked it in accusing naturalists of recognizing a principle independent of God and of restricting divine freedom. To separate natural from imposed properties, Pufendorf distinguishes nature itself from the further properties imposed on nature by the divine will. He argues that nature itself consists simply in bodies in motion, and their effects on one another. No morality can be found simply in movement, and application of physical power; hence rightness and wrongness do not belong to nature in itself, but are imposed. Natural properties are the ones that is recognised by physical sciences. Since right and wrong are not among these properties, they do not belong to nature in itself, and therefore they are imposed. 










#                  Difficulties

- Pufendorf’s mistake of assuming that insofar as God created beings who have moral duties to God (as God the Creator), God is the legislator who creates obligations by legislation.
- Pufendorf argues, that morality requires laws, and therefore requires a lawgiver; but that argument still leaves open questions about why we ought to obey the lawgiver.
- - InPufendorf’sview,naturalistsbelieveinsomeprincipleindependentof,andco-eternalwith, God, restricting God’s freedom, because they believe in natural rightness and wrongness apart from God’s will. Their position is theologically unsound, since God created us by the exercise of free will, and God was free to do otherwise than create us with this nature. Nothing can be good or bad by intrinsic necessity, apart from the pleasure and the imposition of God.⁸ When we speak of natural rightness and wrongness, we do not refer to anything independent of the will of God; we simply refer to what is required by the natural condition that the Creator has freely given to us.⁹ Human beings with their nature are creatures of God, and so the nature of right actions depends on God’s will as creator.¹⁰ A naturalist position makes the existence of human beings with their nature independent of God’s will as creator, but Grotius has overlooked this unwelcome result of naturalism. The view that Pufendorf attributes to naturalism is more extreme than the view of mediaeval naturalists, Suarez and Grotius. All of these naturalists distinguish the creative from the legislative will of God.
- even if the existence of human beings for whom justice is good depends on the divine will, it does not follow that the fact that their good requires justice also depends on the divine will. Naturalists are right to argue that Christian doctrines about creation do not affect their claims about the independence of morality.¹³ If, therefore, Pufendorf simply asserts that created things depend on God’s creative will and indicative law, he has not refuted the naturalism of Suarez and Grotius.
