- Rawls think that Kant not only describes the morality in general, but gives a prominent normative postition - In Rawls’s view, Kant provides the basis for a viable non-utilitarian theory of morality. Rawls agrees, against Sidgwick, with Kant’s estimate of the importance of his position. Kant believes that his account of the basis of morality frees rationalist and non-utilitarian positions from the intuitionism of Price and Reid. For the earlier rationalists, ultimate normative principles are irreducibly plural. We are supposed to see the rightness of basic principles of justice, equity, beneficence, and so on, and to see that these principles cannot be subordinated or reduced to any general utilitarian principle. Kant tries to do better. He argues that, once we understand the nature of morality, and in particular its relation to practical reason, we need not appeal to intuition in order to support basic normative principles. We can see that the rational basis for morality is non-utilitarian; for once we see that a genuinely moral principle must appeal to practical reason rather than sentiment, we can infer enough about its content to reject utilitarianism. Instead of recognizing a number of ultimate principles relying on intuitions without further explanation, we unify these principles by showing that they all express the implications of the basic point that a moral principle must appeal to practical reason.
