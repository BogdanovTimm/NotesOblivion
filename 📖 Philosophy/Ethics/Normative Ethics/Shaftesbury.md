- He maintains that moral rightness and wrongness are not dependent on the reaction of observers, and so he accepts one of the main rationalist objections against sentimentalism
- defends independent morality by appealing to a moral sense. 
- He is naturalist about the relation of the divine will to morality, but he is sentimentalist about our knowledge of moral properties 
- Shaftesbury protests against the view that egoism is the only safe alternative to enthusiasm. 
- If Leibniz concedes this point to Shaftesbury, he need not withdraw his claim that divine rewards and punishments are important. Even if they are not necessary to make virtue promote one’s happiness, they may provide signifciant further reasons for believing this claim, and especially for believing that virtue does not require a long-term sacrifice of happiness. Shaftesbury agrees on these points. But it does not follow that divine rewards and punishments are needed to demonstrate that virtue promotes happiness. 
- Shaftesbury is the first to use the terms ‘moral sense’ and ‘moral realist’. Since later believers in a moral sense, Hume and Hutcheson, reject moral realism, we may be surprised that Shaftesbury uses both terms to describe his own position. His philosophical allegiances also seem to lead him in different directions. On many points he agrees with Locke, but he also draws extensively on Platonic and Stoic sources.
- Though Shaftesbury agrees with Locke in general about the reasonable character of Christianity, and about the folly of opposing natural reason to revelation, Locke’s moral position outlook seems to agree with the ‘orthodox’ Christian outlook that Shaftesbury deplores. 
- Shaftesbury seems to maintain a Platonist metaphysics of morality together with a Lockean epistemology and moral psychology. On the one hand, he defends the reality of moral properties, apart from the will or preferences of agents, and the reality of moral virtue, apart from self-confined desires. These two claims constitute his ‘moral realism’. On the other hand, he seems to follow Locke’s views about the basis of knowledge and motivation; knowledge is based on the senses, and motivation on non-rational desire rather than reason. How can we be confident that the sensory basis of cognition, as Locke understands it, will support the belief in the independent reality of moral properties? 
- All of his critics and interpreters agree that he criticizes Hobbesian egoism. We may usefully begin with the criticisms that mark points of agreement with later sentimentalists; then we can ask whether he also criticizes Hobbes from a Platonist direction, and whether these criticisms fit a sentimentalist outlook. 
- According to Shaftesbury, we are immediately aware of moral goodness and rightness; we do not come to believe actions are right, or that people are good, as a result of considering whether they promote someone’s pleasure. We approve of them from an unselfsih point of view that considers the public interest.⁶ Those who are appropriately sensitive to moral goodness have more than a tendency towards benevolent actions; they also have the capacity to reflect on this tendency and to ‘take notice of what is worthy or honest; and make that notice or conception of worth and honesty to be an object of his affection’
- ‘A man who in a passion happens to kill his companion relents immediately on the sight of what he has done . . . If, on the other side, we suppose him not to relent or suffer any real concern or shame; then either he has no sense of the deformity of the crime and injustice, no natural affection, and consequently no happiness or peace within: or if he has any sense of moral worth or goodness, it must be of a perplexed and contradictory kind’
- This recognition of moral properties may be compared to sense-perception. Conscience expresses itself in judgments about the rightness of this or that action, as well as in the grasp of general principles. Both aspects of conscience are often immediate, not involving any explicit reasoning and derivation. Hence they may be described as a sense of right and wrong.⁷ Shaftesbury uses such expressions to refer to these immediate reactions to particular situations.⁸ 
- A different basis for belief in a moral sense is the assimilation of moral to aesthetic awareness. We have found this assimilation in Culverwell, who describes natural rightness (honestas) and wrongness (turpitudo) as proper objects of admiration and disgust; he regards them as appealing and repellent, apart from any narrow self-interest. Aesthetic responses offer a useful parallel to moral reactions in being both immediate and disinterested. If we fnid something beautiful, appealing, repulsive, or disgusting, we do not seem to be recording a conclusion we have reached on the basis of any reasoning; nor do we seem to be reporting on our own interest. The disinterestedness of our appreciation of beauty suggests how we might appreciate moral goodness and badness in a similarly disinterested way. According to Shaftesbury, we recognize beauty and charm in moral as well as natural objects apart from any views about our own interest (Misc. 5, ch. 3 = K 466). Ancient moralists who speak of the kalon might be taken to rely on this parallel between aesthetic and moral reactions; Shaftesbury treats their remarks as evidence of the parallel.⁹ 
- The comparison between a moral sense and the sense of beauty helps to explain why virtuous people refuse even to consider certain kinds of questions. Shaftesbury compares the question ‘Why be honest in the dark?’ with the question ‘Why keep yourself clean if no one can smell?’ In the second case, he answers that he would not care to associate with someone who needed to ask himself this question and did not take it for granted that he should keep himself clean. The appropriate reaction to not keeping clean is not refelctive, but aesthetic—an immediate sense of disgust. Similarly, virtuous people are not those who can always explain why we should be honest in the dark and therefore always act honestly; they would not dream of asking the question. To be a virtuous person is to be repelled by the very thought of taking this question seriously as though it needed an answer in particular cases  
- ‘The sense of right and wrong’, therefore, captures Stoic claims about the fnie.¹⁰ Shaftesbury agrees with the Stoics’ appeal to the immediate recognition and admiration of actions and characters that benefit others or promote a common good, independently of any benefti to the agent.¹¹ 
- Shaftesbury claims, then, that we are aware of moral rightness and wrongness by some sort of quasi-aesthetic sense that includes some pleasure sufficient for motivation. Our ‘inward eye’ distinguishes fair and foul in actions and characters no less than in other beautiful and ugly objects. Disputes about what is fair and foul presuppose that we have some conception of the relevant qualities; otherwise we could not identify the area of dispute.¹² Our ordinary moral sentiments of gratitude, resentment, pride, and shame presuppose some conception of the relevant moral qualities that are the proper objects of the sentiments. To explain the connexion between sentiment and principle, Shaftesbury alludes to the Stoic doctrine of ‘preconceptions’ or ‘anticipations’ (proleˆpseis); he claims that we have ‘a natural presumption or anticipation on which resentment or anger is founded’ (Mor. 3.2 = Char. ii 419 = K 329).¹³ This natural ‘presumption’ embodies an implicit principle that guides our sentiment, and attention to the sentiment reveals the underlying principle.¹⁴ 
- The aesthetic character of the moral sentiment does not compromise the objectivity of moral properties or the rationality of moral principles. Shaftesbury accepts the Stoic doctrine of the honestum as what deserves praise in its own right, apart from whether it is actually praised.¹⁵ He advocates the cultivation of moral taste and a sense of moral appropriateness that will be as keen as the cultivated person’s sense of the appropriate and suitable in clothes, or paintings, or music, because he believes that this sense of appropriateness will make us aware of moral facts, and especially of the admirable characteristics of actions and characters that are concerned for others. The sense of moral appropriateness is not a substitute for grasp of the right principles, but it is an essential support for it; if our sentiments diverge sharply from the actions enjoined by our principles, they will counteract the effect of our principles.¹⁶ 
- In arguing for a moral sense Shaftesbury intends a claim about motivation as well as judgment. We are not only capable of judging from an impartial point of view, but also capable of acting on this point of view. Awareness of cruelty or injustice moves us to action because it is cruelty or injustice, whether or not it affects our own interest. This capacity for action on disinterested motives confilcts with Hobbes’s psychological hedonism. Inthelightofthisaffirmationofnon-egoisticmotivation,somereadershavebeensurprised by Shaftesbury’s discussion of our ‘obligation’ to virtue. This term often causes confusion in the British moralists; but in this context Shaftesbury explains himself by identifying our obligation with our ‘reason to embrace it’ (ICV ii 1.1 = K 192).¹⁷ He answers this question by explaining why virtue promotes the agent’s happiness. He does not directly say that this is the only reason we could have for embracing virtue; but since he suggests no other reason, he seems to assume that a suffciient reason for being virtuous must at least include a warranted belief that virtue promotes one’s happiness. 
- We might be surprised that Shaftesbury mentions only this reason for being virtuous, after what he has said about the disinterested character of the moral sense.¹⁸ Martineau voices this disappointment strongly; he suggests that after affirming the possibility of disinterested motivation, Shaftesbury reverts to a self-interested hedonist outlook.¹⁹ Martineau cites the remarks about the moral sense in order to show that Shaftesbury recognizes a basis of moral goodness that is independent of any appeal to self-interest. A virtuous person is one who regards the moral properties of actions as the sources of sufficient reasons in their own right. Why, then, should some reason based in self-interest be needed? Shaftesbury’s acceptance both of a disinterested conception of a moral sense and of a self-interested defence of morality should not surprise us as much as it surprises Martineau. We need only recall the structure of eudaemonist ethical theories. If we understand the pursuit of happiness as the pursuit of rational structure and harmony in our different activities, it is reasonable to examine the contribution of virtue to happiness. 
- He agrees with Cumberland that virtuous people’s outlook does not subordinate the common good to their own pleasure. In his view, the affection for the public interest is a source of pleasures.²¹ These pleasures arise partly from sympathetic participation in the pleasures of others (ICV ii 2.1 = 202 K), and partly from refelxion on and approval of our own benevolent attitudes. This reflective conscience is distinct from fear of punishment, even of divine punishment; someone who observes the requirements of morality simply from the fear of divine punishment lacks a necessary condition for conscience. This is a hedonist defence of virtue only if Shaftesbury means that the social and sympathetic pleasures enjoyed by a virtuous person are greater than those enjoyed by others, as estimated from a neutral point of view. The virtuous person, on this view, gets more pleasure than the vicious person, just as we get more pleasure from savouring each bite of a well-cooked dish than we get from bolting it down without tasting it properly. Shaftesbury, however, does not seem to intend his claims about pleasure to be understood in this way.²³ He suggests that it is trifling to say that pleasure is our good, because ‘will’ and ‘pleasure’ are synonymous. To say that we do what we please, or that we aim at our pleasure, simply means that we choose what we think eligible. In asking where we should seek our pleasure, we are asking what is really eligible; we should be asking how to distinguish good from bad pleasure (Mor. 2.1 = K 250–1). If we identify happiness with pleasure, we are saying that our good consists in doing what we like; but since our preferences and likings change, identification of our good with the satisfaction of our preferences makes our good variable and unstable
- expression of concern for others is a vital part of our interest. Opponents of this claim about virtue and happiness rely on a narrow conception of interest and happiness that obscures the real questions.²⁴ 
- We can clarify the issue about happiness once we recognize that a person’s good is not to be defined simply by reference to the satisfaction of desires. As Shaftesbury puts it, the good does not depend entirely on ‘fancy’, because ‘there is that in which the nature of man is satisfeid, and which alone must be his good’ (Mor. iii 3 = Char. ii 436 = K 335). In the light of our conception of human nature, we can see which passions are suitable to us, and fnid an appropriate ‘balance of . . . passions’, constituting ‘beauty and decorum’ in one’s internal states (Mor. ii 4 = Char. ii 294 = K 277). Contrary to Hobbes, we find that society and the aims and affections that support it are natural to human beings. The pleasures that belong to social sentiment are part of a human being’s happiness not because they are greater than any other pleasures, but because of their role in the human good.²⁵ 
- we may with justice surely place it as a principle, ‘that if anything be natural in any creature or any kind, it is that which is preservative of the kind itself, and conducing to its welfare . . . If any appetite or sense be natural, the sense of fellowship is the same’
- Since the good appropriate to human nature consists in the right internal order of self-regarding and other-regarding sentiments and passions, happiness comes from within and not from outside a person (Mor. iii 2 = K 335). Non-moral goods benefti us only if they are used properly. The moral good, by contrast, is good in its own right; it is most agreeable in itself, and preferable to all these external goods (Mor. iii 2 = K 332). The awareness of good order in one’s own nature is the source of a higher enjoyment than we receive from other sources - so, we might see that Shaftesbury is not a hedonists.
- Shaftesbury seems to recognize this point when he discusses the human good. In claiming that the human good includes the satisfaction of the social affections, he does not claim that by satisfying these affections we gain more pleasure, or that people always or often care most about satisfaction of these affections. He claims that these are the affections that deserve to be satisfeid. 
- Shaftesbury is closer to Platonism than to Locke. Though many remarks suggest that he takes Hobbes’s and Locke’s view on virtue and happiness, the main tendency of his position agrees with the Greek moralists whom he cites with approval. His account of our ‘obligation’ to virtue is expressed as a claim about enjoyment, but it is really an argument for the position of the Greek moralists, that virtue is a part of the human good, correctly conceived. A Lockean interpretation of Shaftesbury is easy and attractive; it leads Hutcheson to his defence of Shaftesbury. But closer inspection shows that it does not capture Shaftesbury’s position. 
- A voluntarist might reply that Shaftesbury misunderstands the relation between the categorical claim in (1) and the counterfactual in (2). In (1) we refer to what is just, according to God’s ordered power. In (2) we refer to what would be just if God had not exercised absolute power in the way God has in fact exercised it, but had made it just to punish one person for the crimes of another. This is how Scotus exploits Anselm’s claim that what God wills is necessarily just.⁴⁰ If this is a legitimate reply, Shaftesbury does not demonstrate that voluntarists are committed to the truth of contradictions. But if voluntarists try this answer to Shaftesbury, they need to explain what they mean in claiming that God is just or that God’s decisions are just. If we entirely separate justice from the traits and actions that involve fairness, reciprocity, respect for desert, and so on, we are not claiming what we might initially have appeared to be claiming in saying that God is just; it is not clear that we ascribe any definite moral property to God at all. Voluntarists would be better off, therefore, if they denied that God is essentially just. By an exercise of absolute power God chooses to be just, but not because it is better to be just than to be unjust; if God had chosen differently, it would have been better to be unjust than to be just. This is a consistent position that avoids Shaftesbury’s objection about contradiction. 








#                  Difficulties

- Sometimes he seems to be an anti-rationalist about motivation and action.²⁰ He argues that the choice of one end over another, in cases where instrumental reasoning cannot decide the issue, must be the outcome of the different impacts of desires of different strengths. It is not clear, however, whether he believes that every desire must be the outcome of some prior non-rational desire focussed by instrumental reasoning. Hutcheson commits himself to this aspect of anti-rationalism, but Shaftesbury does not go so far. His attitude to hedonism is also imprecise. He distinguishes the virtuous person from the straightforwardly calculating hedonist who considers, as Hobbes’s ‘fool’ does, whether this or that virtuous action will promote his own interest. To reject the attitude of the fool, however, is not to reject one’s own pleasure as a ground for pursuing the virtues in general. And Shaftesbury seems to rely on a hedonist assumption. In his view, happiness ‘is generally computed’ from pleasures or satisfactions (ICV ii 2.1 = K 201).
- But what does he take to be the connexion between our reason for pursuing morality and our inclination to be moral? Does he believe that we have reasons, independent of inclination, to strengthen inclinations that favour morality? Or does he believe that if our inclinations favouring morality weakened, we would have less reason to pursue morality? The choice between these two views determines how far Shaftesbury goes in accepting rationalism about reasons and naturalism about the human good. We might reasonably expect him to favour the naturalist answer that takes reasons to be distinct from strength of desire; for he normally claims that human happiness depends on human nature, not that it depends on human desires. But he does not seem to reach a clear view about the nature of our reasons to favour morality. This is the basis of Butler’s objection to Shaftesbury. Since Butler sympathizes with Shaftesbury’s naturalism, he notices the place where Shaftesbury fails (in Butler’s view) to recognize the implications of a naturalist defence of morality.³¹
