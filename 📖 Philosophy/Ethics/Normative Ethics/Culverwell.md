- He defends some aspects of Scholastic naturalism, and especially of Suarez’s version of it, against a voluntarist interpretation of Calvinism. He is a Calvinist himself; he opposes both Arminians and Antinomians, and argues that Calvinist views on nature and grace do not rule out, but support, reliance on natural law and natural reason.²²

- without a divine command some courses of action are unreasonable, and others are rationally appropriate, but no action is morally right or wrong because none is obligatory
- Culverwell recognizes intrinsic rightness and wrongness, but he gives them a quasi-aesthetic interpretation that is alien to Suarez.
- Both Suarez and Culverwell allow natural rightness, though they disagree about whether it can support duties.
- Even Hobbes, who goes furthest in a voluntarist direction, believes that what fits human nature is independent of God’s legislative will; that is why the laws of nature are counsels of self-preservation. But Hobbes does not believe that God commands obedience to these natural laws because they preserve human society; the commands are not an exercise of God’s benevolence or of God’s care for creation, but of God’s power. Culverwell, Locke, Cumberland, and Pufendorf reject this part of Hobbes’s view; they agree that in some way God necessarily chooses to command observance of the natural law that preserves human society. On this point they agree with Suarez. They differ from Suarez, and from one another, in their views about whether the element of natural law that is independent of command and will is also morality. None of them defends Suarez’s combination of naturalism (about right and wrong) and voluntarism (about obligation and law).

- He takes himself to agree with Suarez about the natural goodness and badness, or ‘convenience’ and ‘disconvenience’ of things. This aspect of morality is independent of God’s legislative will.²³ But, as Suarez and Sanderson argue, a divine command is necessary for genuine moral obligation; the ‘height and perfection of a law’ depends on a divine command. Culverwell claims that, according to Suarez, natural goodness, without divine commands, imposes a ‘natural obligation’, but not a moral obligation, to pursue it.²⁴ Morality and moral obligation depend on a law, and hence a divine command.²⁵ This account misunderstands Suarez on natural and moral obligation.²⁶ Suarez says that natural law presupposes a natural duty (debitum), to which it adds a natural obligation. By this he means that it is natural as opposed to civil, but not that it is natural as opposed to moral. Contrary to Culverwell, Suarez allows no obligation without law, and no natural obligation without moral obligation; natural obligation is natural because it is the moral obligation imposed by natural law. He distinguishes duty (debitum) from obligation, and makes duty independent of law. Law is not necessary for morality. Though law introduces a moral obligation, it does not introduce moral duties. The error in Culverwell’s summary of Suarez may be expressed in two ways. (1) If he intends to follow Suarez’s use of ‘obligation’, he is wrong to suppose that Suarez recognizes any obligation independent of the will of an imposer who imposes the obligation by a command. (2) If he uses ‘obligation’ in a broader sense, matching Suarez’s use of ‘duty’, he is wrong to suppose that Suarez recognizes no moral obligation in nature. Perhaps the second description of Culverwell’s error is more accurate. English moralists tend to use ‘obligation’ more broadly than Suarez uses it, so that ‘obligation’ applies where ‘duty’ and ‘ought’ apply.²⁷ This broad use of ‘obligation’ is intelligible, but it may lead us to misunderstand Suarez; for ‘obligation’ (in the broad English sense) includes both duties (as he describes them) and the proper subset of duties that he calls obligations. 
- Culverwell’s attempt to express the difference between intrinsic rightness and obligation does not capture Suarez’s position; it rejects one of his central claims. Though Culverwell believes he expounds Suarez, his exposition incorporates voluntarist assumptions, alien to Suarez, about morality, obligation, compulsion, and command. These voluntarist assumptions conflict with Suarez’s basic division between intrinsic morality and natural law. The assumptions are more prominent and explicit in Hobbes, Locke, Cumberland, and Pufendorf; they all abandon Culverwell’s unsatisfactory compromise, and prefer a more thoroughly voluntarist position that rejects intrinsic rightness.

- Culverwell’s misunderstanding of Suarez reflects his own views about the necessary conditions for morality. He accepts Suarez’s alleged view that non-moral natural obligations are independent of law, but he believes (again supposing that he follows Suarez) that morality requires law, because morality requires moral obligation, and reason cannot bind (oblige) us without reference to the will of God. In acknowledging my action as morally wrong, I acknowledge that it is liable to punishment. If I did not take its wrongness to imply the transgression of a divine command, I would not, according to Culverwell, take it to be liable to the sort of punishment that I ought to accept as justified.²⁸
