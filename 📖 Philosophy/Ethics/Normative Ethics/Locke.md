- He is natural law moralist
- reason is and ought to be the slave of the passions 
- Morality depends on natural law, and hence on Divine commands, and that the natural foundation of morality consists in natural, but non-moral, goodness and badness. He allows natural ‘convenience’, but resolves it into pleasure and advantage without any natural rightness. 
- Voluntarist about relation between God and morality
- Dismisses Aristotelian metaphysics as hopelessly antiscientifci, primitive, and obscure.
- The only natural goods are the pleasant (iucundum) and the advantageous (utile)
- It is useful, though no doubt too simple, to understand both Locke’s moral psychology and his moral theory as an uneasy and unstable compromise between Hobbes and Cudworth. The main outlines of his views seem Hobbesian, but the qualifications that he introduces bring him closer to Cudworth, and therefore to the Scholastic position. The Hobbesian outlines are more influential; they explain Shaftesbury’s judgment that Locke struck ‘the home blow’ for Hobbesian principles.² But the qualifications show why one might not be content with the Hobbesian outlines. 
- He begins by claiming that recognition of the greater good does not move us to action.⁴ Here he rejects an extreme intellectualist view that the mere belief that x is better than y moves me to choose x over y. We might prefer the moderate intellectualist view that some desires moving us to action depend essentially on practical reason, and hence on beliefs about the good. According to this view (held by Aquinas), we would not be rational agents if we lacked these desires, constituting a will.⁵ Locke rejects this moderate intellectualist view as well. He does not merely insist that knowledge without desire is insufficient for action. He also holds an anti-rationalist conception of desire as ‘an uneasiness of the mind for want of some absent good’ (EHU ii 21.31 = R 174). An ‘uneasiness’ is some desire independent of reasoning about the good. Any exercise of practical reason infulencing our desire presupposes some desire, not formed by practical reason, for some end. In each action our end is pleasure, forming our conception of good; our ultimate end is happiness,⁶ which is an extreme of pleasure. 
- Locke rejects Aquinas’ view of the character of happiness and its role in explaining desire. Aquinas regards happiness as ultimate because it is universal; it is not a specifci end that excludes the pursuit of other things for their own sake. Hence, our pursuit of happiness for its own sake does not yet give us any specific goal of our desire. On these points Locke disagrees, since he treats happiness as pleasure. If we pursue pleasure as our only ultimate end, we do not pursue types of actions or states of character for their own sake, since these other things cannot be components of pleasure in the way they can be components of happiness (as Aristotle and Aquinas understand happiness).⁷

- It is difficult to say whether hedonism or anti-rationalism comes first in Locke’s argument. Each claim supports the other, but both are open to dispute.
