- He is natural law moralist
- reason is and ought to be the slave of the passions 
- Morality depends on natural law, and hence on Divine commands, and that the natural foundation of morality consists in natural, but non-moral, goodness and badness. He allows natural ‘convenience’, but resolves it into pleasure and advantage without any natural rightness. 
- Voluntarist about relation between God and morality
- Dismisses Aristotelian metaphysics as hopelessly antiscientifci, primitive, and obscure.
- The only natural goods are the pleasant (iucundum) and the advantageous (utile)
- It is useful, though no doubt too simple, to understand both Locke’s moral psychology and his moral theory as an uneasy and unstable compromise between Hobbes and Cudworth. The main outlines of his views seem Hobbesian, but the qualifications that he introduces bring him closer to Cudworth, and therefore to the Scholastic position. The Hobbesian outlines are more influential; they explain Shaftesbury’s judgment that Locke struck ‘the home blow’ for Hobbesian principles.² But the qualifications show why one might not be content with the Hobbesian outlines. 
- He begins by claiming that recognition of the greater good does not move us to action.⁴ Here he rejects an extreme intellectualist view that the mere belief that x is better than y moves me to choose x over y. We might prefer the moderate intellectualist view that some desires moving us to action depend essentially on practical reason, and hence on beliefs about the good. According to this view (held by Aquinas), we would not be rational agents if we lacked these desires, constituting a will.⁵ Locke rejects this moderate intellectualist view as well. He does not merely insist that knowledge without desire is insufficient for action. He also holds an anti-rationalist conception of desire as ‘an uneasiness of the mind for want of some absent good’ (EHU ii 21.31 = R 174). An ‘uneasiness’ is some desire independent of reasoning about the good. Any exercise of practical reason infulencing our desire presupposes some desire, not formed by practical reason, for some end. In each action our end is pleasure, forming our conception of good; our ultimate end is happiness,⁶ which is an extreme of pleasure. 
- Locke rejects Aquinas’ view of the character of happiness and its role in explaining desire. Aquinas regards happiness as ultimate because it is universal; it is not a specifci end that excludes the pursuit of other things for their own sake. Hence, our pursuit of happiness for its own sake does not yet give us any specific goal of our desire. On these points Locke disagrees, since he treats happiness as pleasure. If we pursue pleasure as our only ultimate end, we do not pursue types of actions or states of character for their own sake, since these other things cannot be components of pleasure in the way they can be components of happiness (as Aristotle and Aquinas understand happiness).
- He uses Hobbesian arguments to show that we cannot intelligibly attribute freedom or unfreedom to the will, and that we act freely as long as we act on our desires rather than being forced by external pressure
- He agrees with Hobbes and Hutcheson that action depends ultimately on some non-rational impulse, which Locke calls ‘uneasiness’. Apparently, then, he ought to say that action is the result of the strongest desire, so that the greater uneasiness always determines our action. Locke, however, suggests that this appeal to strength of desire is too simple. We can ‘suspend’ the execution of our desires; we consider whether it is really good or bad to satisfy them, and we try to decide which ones it is better on the whole to satisfy.¹² This is ‘not a fault, but a perfection of our nature’ (47). Here we find freedom that is no less genuine than the sort of freedom that implies indeterminism. Determination in itself is no obstacle to freedom. The capacity for ‘suspension’ and rational consideration raises a diffciulty for Hobbesian simple compatibilism. It conflicts with Hobbes’s view that all action caused by desire is equally free; for someone who acts on passion without the refelxion that Locke describes is less free than someone who acts as a result of rational refelxion. And so a Hobbesian compatibilist account of action deprives us of a type of freedom that is morally significant. Locke implies that, within a compatibilist account of freedom, rationally determined actions are freer than others. It is difficult, however, for a simple compatibilist, and for Locke, to explain how we examine competing desires and weigh one of their objects against another. Locke argues that when we recognize that there is more to be said for choosing x than for choosing y, we also recognize that it is more reasonable to choose x rather than y, and that in choosing x we choose the better. He therefore recognizes some special connexion between reason and the choice of the better.¹⁵ If we choose the better, we do not simply choose on the basis of instrumental reasoning; for we also rely on instrumental reasoning in choosing the means to satisfy an incontinent desire. Why, then, is it more rational to act on this prudent desire (the one for maximum overall pleasure) than to act on the incontinent desire? Contrary to a Hobbesian account, practical reason seems to tell us which end it is more reasonable to pursue; hence it does not seem to be confnied to deliberation about instrumental means to some end that appeals to us independently of reason. The same question arises for Hobbes in his attempts to connect practical reason with judgments about the future. Locke, therefore, raises serious objections to Hobbes’s position. He recognizes the existence of rational desires for the better, which do not allow a sentimentalist analysis. These desires cast doubt on the sentimentalist account of freewill and of the virtues; for if the sentimentalist conception of virtue does not make rational desire primary, it seems to undermine freewill.

- It is difficult to say whether hedonism or anti-rationalism comes first in Locke’s argument. Each claim supports the other, but both are open to dispute.
