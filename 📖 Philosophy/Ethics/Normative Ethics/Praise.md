Praise and blame look forward, since they seek to modify the agent. They also look backwards, since they presuppose that the agent was open to praise and blame in choosing to behave one way or another, and therefore that he could reasonably have been expected to take account of these consequences when he decided what to do. This retrospective aspect of praise and blame distinguishes them from the mere attempt to change someoneâ€™s behaviour in the future; it is also needed to justify the infliction of punishment in cases where future reform (of a bad man) is not to be expected.
