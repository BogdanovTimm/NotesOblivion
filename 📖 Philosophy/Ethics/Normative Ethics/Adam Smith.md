- Ascribe to the Stoics the view that gaining external goods is a game of skill of reasoning for virtuous people. On this basis Adam Smith ascribes an adaptive conception of happiness to the Stoics.
- Sentimentalism is true: the extent to which we are capable of sympathy defines the extent of concern.
- The assertion that meta-ethical conclusions are practically unimportant is part of Smith’s defence of sentimentalism. Some opponents of sentimentalism claim that it undermines morality. Hume answers that the debate between sentimentalism and rationalism concerns a question of purely theoretical interest, so that a decision in favour of sentimentalism could not tend to undermine morality. Smith adds nothing to Hume on this point.
- He believes that moral judgment must be traced back to sentiments, because he agrees with Hutcheson and Hume in believing that moral distinctions are not derived from reason.
Like Hutcheson, he accepts some of the rationalist critique of Hobbes, but he believes that Hutcheson has shown that the true points in this critique do not require the acceptance of rationalism. He agrees with Cudworth’s argument against Hobbes’s positivism, but he believes that Cudworth was wrong to assume that the moral principles prior to law are rational principles. Cudworth’s error was excusable, since in his time no option besides reason had been considered.³ But Hutcheson made the further advances in the science of human nature that settle the issue about reason.⁴ In Smith’s view, Hutcheson’s discussion of the role of reason shows how we can accept what is sound in Cudworth’s criticism of Hobbes without embracing rationalism.⁵
- If Smith is right to agree with Hutcheson against the rationalists, Balguy is wrong to suppose that Cudworth’s argument against Hobbes’s legal positivism also undermines Hutcheson’s sentimentalism. In that case, rationalist arguments against voluntarism and positivism do not apply to sentimentalism. Hutcheson argues, against Balguy, that he allows the corrigibility of the moral sense. He relies on the parallel with the external senses, and hence allows the correction of one person’s sense by reference to the normal perceiver, where ‘normal’ is understood not normatively but statistically. According to Hutcheson, this degree of corrigibility allows us to reject Hobbesian positivism without embracing rationalism.
Balguy replies that Hutcheson’s account of corrigibility does not answer the case against Hobbes. For if moral judgments allow only the sort of correction that Hutcheson describes, we can adjust them to the normal judge’s reactions, but we cannot criticize the normal moral judge. But morality (in Balguy’s view) is not mutable in relation to the reactions of the normal judge. According to Balguy and Price, we regard the moral sense as correct only if it corresponds to some principles of right and wrong that are independent of it; that is Cudworth’s reply to Hobbes’s appeal to law as the basis of right.
- Though Smith agrees with Hutcheson and Hume in rejecting rationalism, he rejects their arguments for tracing moral judgments to a moral sense. In his view, Hutcheson introduced a moral sense because he had correctly eliminated reason and self-love as the source of moral judgments, but could not find their source in any other recognized mental capacity;
hence he needed some new capacity. He called it the moral sense because he took it to be somewhat analogous to the external senses, and also somewhat analogous to the ‘reflex senses’ whose operations result from the operations of other senses
- Smith criticizes Hutcheson on three grounds:
    - We make moral judgments about our moral sentiments themselves. The first line of criticism is reasonable. It exploits Balguy’s objection that the moral sense is corrigible because we apply moral criticism to someone’s moral sentiments, on the assumption that they are capable of improvement, and that they reflect moral credit or discredit on a person (vii 3.3.8–10, 322–4). Hutcheson tries to explain some criticisms of a particular agent’s moral sense, by reference to the moral sense of the ‘normal’ observer. But if ‘normal’ just means ‘statistically most frequent’, he does not answer Balguy’s objection.
Smith implicitly agrees with Balguy; for if Hutcheson’s appeal to the normal observer refuted Balguy, it would refute Smith too
    - Moral judgments are too various to be expressions of a single sentiment or emotion. The second objection to an appeal to the moral sense is more relevant to Hume than to Hutcheson. Though Hume follows Hutcheson in appealing to a moral sense, he does not rely as strongly on an analogy with the other senses. Often he speaks of a certain kind of feeling. Smith is right to suppose that—given Hume’s view of feelings—this account of moral judgment requires the relevant feeling to be introspectively similar in all moral judgments.¹³ If we were to claim that the identity of the moral sentiment consists in the judgment on which it is based, we would no longer make the moral sense primary; hence Hume assumes that introspective similarity is the common feature of all expressions of the moral sense.¹⁴ Against this assumption Smith points out that the sentiments connected with approval of different kinds of actions and characters vary with the objects of our approval.
They have no specific feeling in common 
    - Even if we exclude reason and self-interest, other recognized mental capacities can explain moral judgments, and so we do not need a new one. These two objections prepare for the third objection, which rests on a positive account of moral judgment. Smith rejects any appeal to a distinct moral sense. He regards this notion as an unnecessary innovation.¹⁶ His account of moral judgment is intended to show that the relevant features of moral judgment can be explained without reference to a special sense.
In his view, the relevant facts about moral judgment are to be explained by the operation of sympathy. The feeling connected with moral approval varies according to our sympathetic reaction to the trait of character that we approve of.¹⁷ Moreover, we approve of proper approval by another, and disapprove of improper approval. In this case our moral attitude is to be understood as coincidence or opposition between our sentiments and those of the other person. Why, he asks, should the same not be true in every case
- In these arguments Smith does not draw the extreme conclusion that no sort of sentiment is essential to moral judgment. He believes that the common feature of moral judgments is not the similarity of sentiment, considered in its own right, but the fact that we find the same relation of our own sentiment to the sentiment of another. The common feature is the operation of sympathy.
In opposition to the moral sense theory, Smith claims that the different operations of sympathy give an account of moral judgments.¹⁸ The successive stages in our reactions help us to answer both of the main questions of ethical theory, about which traits are virtues, and about how we judge that they are. A trait is a virtue insofar as it arouses sympathy from different points of view; and we judge that a trait is a virtue insofar as we react to it sympathetically. The close connexion between Smith’s answers to these two questions raises even more doubts about his claim that the first is practically important and the second is not. 
- Though Smith criticizes Hutcheson and Hume for introducing a moral sense, he agrees with their aim of finding a reductive account of moral judgment. His description of the moral sentiments is intended to capture the content and nature of moral judgments. Hence his account is open to objection if the sentiments he describes are either insufficient or unnecessary for some clear cases of apparent moral judgment. 
- Smith sometimes recognizes the appropriate counterfactual basis for fellow-feeling. He sees that sympathy requires not that I consider myself with my feelings in your situation, but I consider myself being you and having the feelings that you have or would have. 
- But even the more plausible account of the counterfactual basis of sympathy does not seem to cover all cases of appropriate sympathy. Smith recognizes some cases in which sympathy seems appropriate, but seems not to be based on my imagining what you feel:
    - We feel anguish at the sight of people who have lost their reason, even if they seem quite cheerful about it. The counterfactual suppositions on which this anguish is based are inconsistent; I suppose myself suffering terribly if I were aware of myself in that situation, though at the same time I suppose that if I were in that situation I would not be aware of it, and hence would not suffer.²² 
    - A mother feels agony for her child suffering from a disease, even though the child cannot have the fears for the future that explain the mother’s anxiety.
    - We feel sorry for the dead because we imagine ourselves both being dead (and so having no consciousness) and being aware of being dead (and so being conscious).²³ 
- To see why such reactions (mother that feels sympathy to a dideased child and our sympathy to a crazy people) are appropriate, we should distinguish two kinds of ‘fellow-feeling’. 
    - One kind is a passion in us that corresponds to a passion in the other person.
This is the reaction advised by St Paul in ‘Rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep’.²⁴ 
    - Another kind is a passion in us that is directed to the other person’s situation. Smith recognizes these two passions, but he tries to explain the second by reference to the first, by introducing counterfactual passions that are reproduced in actual passions. 
- The difference between passions based on evaluative judgments and passions based on counterfactual passions (described above) can be seen more clearly in cases where the two kinds of passions conflict. Suppose that A sees B taking cruel pleasure in causing pain to C, and that A knows both that A also tends to enjoy the pleasures that a cruel person would enjoy and that A is insensitive to pain. Smith’s analysis requires A to reflect: ‘If I were in B’s situation, I would enjoy causing pain to C, and if I were in C’s situation, I would not care much about the pain I suffered from B’. According to Smith, then, A will have fellow-feeling for B rather than C. But if A is a moderately good person, this analysis does not fit; for A recognizes that these features of A are not a good reason for denying that B is doing unjustified harm to C.
Hence A’s sympathy for C rests on A’s judgments about the badness of B’s cruelty and the severity of C’s suffering, not on the feelings that A would have in B’s and C’s situation. If A is a moderately good person, these evaluative judgments cause A to sympathize with C, not with B. 
- This explanation of one kind of sympathy conflicts with one of Smith’s main aims. For the explanation takes sympathy to rest on prior evaluative judgments, contrary to Smith’s aim of explaining evaluative judgments through the operation of sympathy. His reductive account of evaluative judgments does not capture the range of morally appropriate reactions. If his account implies that some morally appropriate actions rest on contradictory assumptions or illusions, the account is open to doubt. Perhaps the doubt is not decisive; we may decide that the illusory character of the suppositions underlying a reaction does not affect the moral appropriateness of the reaction itself. But before we decide this, we may reasonably ask whether Smith’s account is so plausible that we have to accept its less appealing implications. 
- Smith recognizes, however, that this analysis is too narrow.²⁷ I may recognize that a joke is funny, though I am not in the mood to laugh, and that a stranger’s mourning is appropriate even though I do not know enough about him, or have not attended enough to him, to be able to share his grief (i 1.3.4, 17–18). In such cases A approves of B’s feelings even though A does not feel what B feels, and hence A’s and B’s feelings do not agree. Smith explains A’s approval as a judgment by A about A’s counterfactual reactions. The earlier examples we discussed involved the presence of a passion in myself despite its absence in the other (sympathizing with dead people); but approval sometimes involves the presence of a passion in the other and its absence in myself. In this case I judge that I would share your feelings if I considered your situation more closely.²⁸ Smith suggests that our approval is ‘founded upon’ our belief about counterfactual sympathy, as though the approval were something more than this belief. But what more could it be? Smith identified approval with awareness of sympathy (i 1.3.1, 16); since he has replaced ‘sympathy’ with ‘conditional sympathy’, we would expect the consciousness of conditional sympathy to be the approval itself. 
- His discussion of the ‘propriety’: He assumes that if I am to induce other people to recognize my sentiments as appropriate for me in my situation, I have to adjust my sentiments to the type and intensity of sentiments that they are ready to feel for me in my situation. Not only must the spectator exercise imagination to find out what she would feel in the agent’s situation; the agent must also adjust her feelings to those she expects a spectator to feel. Though we cannot achieve complete harmony of sentiments in this way, we can achieve enough ‘for the harmony of society’, so that we do not diverge too much in our response to various situations.³⁰ 
- Different ways of achieving harmony mark a difference between ‘amiable’ and ‘respectable’ virtues:
    - The amiable virtues are those that we approve of by fellow-feeling with the unmodified responses of the other person. Gentleness and kindness involve passions that a spectator readily shares, and therefore endorses. 
    - Other virtues however, require some adjustment of our original passion to the likely reactions of the spectator. The dispositions to modify passions in these ways are the respectable virtues, the ones that involve self-command.³¹ When someone exercises this command beyond the ordinary level, we recognize a virtue of self-command 
- Smith’s treatment of sympathy and approval infulences his description of the different passions and the ways in which they can be proper or improper. He describes them in accordance with the general principle that makes sympathy primary; hence he assumes that we judge these passions appropriate insofar as we approve of them, and that we approve of them insofar as we sympathize with them.³⁶ He relies on two related assumptions: (1) If we cannot easily share a given feeling, we disapprove of it. (2) If we find it easy to share a feeling, we approve of it. 
- His discussion of romantic love relies on the frist assumption. He suggests that the lover’s passions are ‘but little sympathized with’ (i 2.2.1, 31). This is true (we may grant), if we take ‘sympathize’ in Smith’s sense, which requires actually sharing the lover’s particular feelings. But inability to share the lover’s feelings need not inhibit us in ‘fellow-feeling’ or in approval. Someone who listens sympathetically to a lover need not share his passion. If we recognize that lovers tend to find love all-absorbing and to be distracted from other things, and we show special consideration to the lover in these circumstances, that is a way of showing sympathy for the lover. To treat the lover’s sentiments as ridiculous simply because we do not share them would be unreasonably harsh. This example also suggests that we may treat other people sympathetically because of their passions without approving of the passions. We may think they are misguided in particular attachments, but nonetheless show them special consideration. Neither reaction depends on our sharing or not sharing a particular passion, as Smith assumes. 
- The impartiality of the great judge helps us to reach the moral point of view, which corrects the errors of our egocentric perspective. Smith improves on Hume’s account (in the Second Inquiry) of the sentiment of humanity, by distinguishing it from the feeling of benevolence. He notices that benevolence is too weak and too partial to explain our moral judgments. If I think of the suffering of 100 million unknown people, it will affect me less, even if I am benevolent, than the amputation of my little finger. But our moral sentiments are not limited by our benevolence.⁶⁴ When we follow the impartial spectator, we act justly and fairly, without inappropriate bias towards the interest of any of the people affected by our action. This is the point of view that Hutcheson mistakenly traced to the sentiment of benevolence. It incorporates the attitudes that persuaded Butler that conscience could not be identifeid with benevolence. 
- Reference to the impartial spectator and his reactions explains the origin of moral rules and principles. The spectator does not make moral judgments relying primarily on moral principles or rules, but his sympathy is the both the basis for our moral judgments and the criterion of their correctness. A moral rule is a prediction that this kind of action excites the relevant reactions in an impartial observer.⁶⁵ 
- Sympathy as Smith conceives it is different from sympathy as we normally conceive it because it leaves out any moral element. If I sympathize with the sufferings of an innocent victim of a cruel practical joke, my sympathy rests partly on the thought that the victim did not deserve to suffer in this way, and that the practical jokers had no right to do what they did; I do not think simply about what the victim suffers, but also about how the suffering came about. Our ordinary sympathetic reactions seem to be based on judgments about welfare, harm, desert, and fairness; hence they seem to rest on moral rules and principles. Smith cannot allow this sort of sympathy to the impartial spectator; for if the reactions of the spectator rest on moral judgments, they cannot be, as he claims, the foundation of moral rules. But if Smith sticks consistently to non-moral sympathy, he does not explain the scope of our moral judgments
- Smith examines the moral sentiments in detail partly in order to show that sentimentalism does not lead to utilitarianism. Hutcheson supposes that the moral sense approves of benevolence, which takes a utilitarian point of view. Hume is more cautious; but sometimes (especially in the Inquiry) he brings the sentiment of humanity close to benevolence. Against these views Smith argues that utility is only one object of approval for the impartial spectator. The spectator does not take the view that Sidgwick calls ‘the point of view of the universe’, which is guided wholly by the demands of practical reason (as Sidgwick understands them).⁷³ 
- In rejecting a utilitarian analysis of moral sentiment, Smith disagrees with Hutcheson and with Hume. Nonetheless, Smith agrees on one point with utilitarianism. Though our sentiments themselves do not consider utility, the general tendency of our acting on our sentiments is to promote utility, because of a ‘happy adjustment’ by Nature.⁷⁷ We might understand Smith’s reference to Nature theologically, so that he agrees with Berkeley and with the position entertained by Butler, treating God as a utilitarian who has given us non-utilitarian principles to maximize utility. He is inclined to agree, without definitely agreeing, with Hutcheson against Butler that God’s character is purely benevolent (vi 2.3, 235–7; vii 2.3.18, 305).⁷⁸ Alternatively, he might be referring to some quasi-evolutionary process, according to which some social processes select the reactions that tend to maximize utility. Here, as in his better-known reference to the ‘invisible hand’, Smith alludes to some co-ordinating mechanism without describing it very precisely.⁷⁹

- Our irrational sentiments encourage the accumulation of the means of happiness, in the false belief that it increases the happiness of the accumulators. It is socially useful, however, to encourage these irrational sentiments, since the accumulation increases the happiness of others. ‘Providence’ and the ‘invisible hand’ are utilitarians.⁸⁹ 









# Difficulties

- About his view of Stoics: If virtue is happiness, and therefore is the only end of our appropriate actions, virtuous people make an appropriate attempt to protect a child from danger for the sake of their own virtue. They do not aim at the child’s safety, but at the exercise of their virtue in the attempt. It does not seem arbitrary that virtuous people display their practical reason and their fearlessness in defending their community rather than in a daring bank robbery.
- Smith does not comment on this disagreement between Hutcheson and Hume about the ‘positive and arbitrary’ character of the moral sense (as Balguy puts it). But their disagreement raises another question about practical significance. If we agree with Hume that we have no rational or moral basis for critical evaluation of our moral sense, we may not take morality as seriously as we would take it if we thought we had the sort of critical basis that the rationalists suppose we have. Hume concedes this point to the rationalists.
Hutcheson and Smith do not; but Smith does not say what is wrong with Hume’s argument against Hutcheson. 
- Smith, however, is warm in the cause of virtue; he does not suggest that reflexion on the nature of moral virtue or of moral judgment will or should lead us to take morality less seriously or to be less warm in its defence. He returns to Hutcheson’s position, but he gives no reason for preferring it to Hume’s position. 
- we cannot (he assumes) accept Balguy’s arguments as good reasons for favouring rationalism; for we already have decisive reasons for accepting sentimentalism.
But Smith’s reasons for confidence in sentimentalism are open to doubt. His main ground for rejecting rationalism about moral distinctions seems to be his acceptance of a version of internalism about virtue and motivation. In his view, virtue necessarily pleases us, but this effect would not be necessary if our judgment that something is a virtue were a purely rational judgment. If the judgment were purely rational, it would be a contingent fact that virtue pleases some people and displeases others. But since it would be self-contradictory to judge that something is virtuous and not to find it pleasing, moral judgment must include feeling.⁹
- Smith would be on stronger ground if he appealed to a different anti-rationalist argument, more clearly presented by Hume than by Hutcheson. According to this argument, reason itself cannot discover appropriate ends, but can only discover instrumental means to ends, and hence cannot be a source of ultimate justifying reasons. If virtues are sources of ultimate justifying reasons, reason cannot discover the virtues. The virtuous person, according to Hutcheson, regards the good of other people as worth pursuing for its own sake; but we cannot discover by reason that the good of others is worth pursuing for its own sake; and so the virtuous concern must result from something other than a discovery of reason. Reid exposes a weakness in this argument for sentimentalism: even if virtue involves a specific belief about ultimate ends, and even if this belief cannot be further justified, it does not follow that it is a sentiment.¹¹

Reid exposes a weakness in this argument for sentimentalism: even if virtue involves a specific belief about ultimate ends, and even if this belief cannot be further justified, it does not follow that it is a sentiment.¹¹
- Smith advances this discussion through a fuller constructive account of the moral sentiments than Hume offers. He supports the sentimentalist position by describing sentiments that we might plausibly regard as the basis of our moral judgments. If he offers a descriptively adequate account that traces our various moral judgments to their sources in sentiments, he shows that sentimentalism fits the actual range and variety of moral judgments. 
- In the cases we have considered, A’s feeling does not correspond to B’s, but rests on a judgment about A’s counterfactual feeling. But in cases where A’s feeling and B’s agree, Smith claims that A approves of B’s feelings.²⁵ In such cases B’s feelings appear to A to be ‘just and proper and suitable to their objects’, and hence A makes favourable evaluative judgments about B’s passions.²⁶ This is a reductive account of evaluative judgments by reference to sympathy. When A approves of B’s feeling, A simply records the fact that A feels the same as B feels. The analysis refers to no evaluative judgment, but only to a judgment about one’s present feelings. 
- The appeal to conditional sympathy raises questions parallel to those we raised for the claim that judgments about counterfactual passions underlie fellow-feeling. For I might know that, because of some peculiarity of mine, I would not feel sympathy if I were better informed about your situation. I might know that I am a rather cold person, or that I am rather prone to sentimental excesses, and that full information about your situation might result in indifference or in excessive displays of grief or joy. But since I know I have these defects, I might believe your reactions are about right, so that I approve of them. In this case, as in his discussion of fellow-feeling, Smith overlooks the role of evaluative judgments, as distinct from predictions about actual or counterfactual feelings. Hence he does not notice how judgments about my counterfactual feelings in your situation differ from evaluative judgments about your feelings in your situation. 
- To support his identification of approval with recognition of shared feelings, he relies on a parallel with belief. He argues that we cannot approve of another person’s opinions without sharing them, and that therefore the same applies to sentiments.²⁹ This parallel with belief invites two objections (These objections to Smith’s account of sympathy and of approval affect the reductive aspect of his account. He tries to avoid any appeal to evaluative beliefs about the other person, by explaining sympathy and approval as the sharing of sentiments, without reference to evaluative beliefs. His attempted explanation fails; it does not capture the ways in which approval may depart from shared sentiment. Since approval differs from shared sentiment, a correct account of approval has to refer to evaluative beliefs about the object of approval. ): 
    - In some cases we can distinguish approval of another’s belief from sharing the belief. If you and I have access to different evidence bearing on the truth or falsity of p, I might approve of your belief, as being reasonably based on your evidence, even if I hold a different belief, based on different evidence. 
    - But even if Smith is right about some types of belief, beliefs are different from sentiments. If I take your belief that p to rest on conclusive reasons, I must also recognize that these are conclusive reasons for me to believe that p. But the connexion between recognition of reasons and the resulting attitude does not hold in the same way for sentiment; even if I recognize conclusive reasons for abandoning my anger, it does not follow that I abandon my anger. If, then, I take your moderate reaction to an offence to rest on conclusive reasons, I approve your moderate reaction, but I may not have the same reaction. 
- Smith speaks without distinction of two processes of adjustment: 
    - We adjust our sentiments to those that an impartial spectator would approve of.³² 
    - We adjust them to those that an impartial spectator would feel. His account of approval explains why he does not distinguish the two processes. But his examples suggest that the two processes are different, and hence they raise further doubts about his account of approval. If A is resentful at B for B’s killing A’s children, it does not seem obvious that A ought to be no more resentful than S (an impartial spectator) would be. It is true that A ought to demand no worse punishment for B than S would approve, and also true that A ought not to feel more resentment than S would approve.³³ But this does not mean that A ought to feel no more resentment than S would feel. Smith admits that S will normally feel a weaker passion, as a result of imagining what S would feel in A’s situation, and so he infers that we ought not to demand exact matching of sentiments. But his account of approval implies that if A could adjust A’s sentiments so that they agreed more closely with S’s, A would thereby be more deserving of S’s approval. This is not necessarily so; S might think it appropriate for A to feel more resentment than S would feel, and in that case S would approve of A only if A did not adjust A’s sentiments to S’s. Smith points out this appropriate difference between A’s and S’s sentiments, in order to expose the error in the Stoic position. The Stoics (he supposes) advise us to match our emotions in bereavement to the emotions of the impartial spectator contemplating someone else’s bereavement.³⁴ Smith rejects their advice, arguing that we ought not to feel only the sentiments that the impartial spectator would feel.³⁵ But this reasonable objection to the (supposed) Stoic position applies equally to Smith’s account of adjustment. The virtue of self-command, therefore, is not the disposition that Smith describes. We ought not always to adjust our sentiments to those an impartial spectator would have in our situation, or those that other people actually have towards our sentiments. Self-command requires us to adjust our sentiments to those an impartial spectator would approve. But since Smith analyses approval as shared sentiment, he does not mark the difference between a sentiment that impartial spectators approve of and a sentiment that they share. 
- A similar assumption underlies Smith’s claim that we approve of self-command and self-restraint in the display of grief because we cannot share the feelings of those who react more strongly.³⁷ His explanation omits an aspect of self-command that Aristotle notices; the virtuous person bears misfortune calmly ‘not because of insensibility to pain (analgeˆsia), but because he is noble and magnanimous’ (EN 1100b32–3). As uninvolved spectators we contemplate the misfortune of other people calmly, because we are insensible to the pain of the victims. But if we thought the victims were equally insensible, we would not think they displayed any special virtue, but we might simply think they were callous. On Smith’s view, however, the more callous we become towards our own misfortunes or to those of people close to us, the more other people will, and ought to, approve of us. 
- Smith agreeswith Aristotle’sremark that callousnessisnot thesameasself-command. Selfcommand presupposes an intensity of feeling that the impartial spectator lacks; nonetheless the impartial spectator approves of this self-command.⁴⁰ How are we to understand this approval, however, within Smith’s analysis? We might say that the reaction of someone with self-command accords with the ‘sentiment’—the evaluative judgment—of impartial spectators, but not with their ‘sentiment’—their feeling. But Smith cannot consistently recognize these two senses of ‘sentiment’; his analysis of moral judgments into sentiments rather than judgments requires strict adherence to the second sense, referring to emotions as distinct from judgments. Reid sees that Smith uses ‘sentiment’ in this second sense.⁴¹ 
- It is difficult to see how the reactions of someone who has not suffered the loss that a grieving parent has suffered could be a reasonable measure of the grief appropriate for a grieving parent. The judgment of appropriateness should be a judgment about that agent in that situation. By trying to reduce the judgment of appropriateness to similarity of sentiment, Smith transforms a reasonable judgment—that your reaction is inappropriate because your situation demands a different reaction—into an unreasonable judgment—that your reaction is inappropriate because it is not how I would react to your situation. Perhaps this criticism of Smith is unfair; for he observes that a spectator may sometimes approve of other people’s reactions without sharing their feelings. But his account of approval does not allow him to take proper account of this observation, since he analyses approval as actual or counterfactual sharing of sentiments. 
- In contrast to cases where we approve of someone’s sentiment without sharing it, Smith also considers cases where we share someone’s sentiment but do not approve of it. We tend to sympathize with the prosperity of the rich and powerful, because we imagine ourselves sharing the feelings of satisfaction that we (falsely) attribute to people in their situation.⁴² Smith notices that this tendency is socially useful, because it supports ‘the distinction of ranks, and the order of society’ (i 3.2.3, 52), apart from any expectation of benefti from our superiors. But he does not approve of it without qualification; on the contrary, he mentions it as a source of the ‘corruption’ of our moral sentiments (i 3.3.1, 61). We go wrong because we allow our sympathy for the powerful and prosperous to create respect and admiration for them, even though such respect and admiration should be reserved for wisdom and virtue. Similarly, we treat failure and poverty with the contempt that we should reserve for vice and folly. 
- In contrast to Hume, Smith does not argue that because we fnid these qualities agreeable to us, we have a moral sentiment in favour of them. On the contrary, he denies that our sympathy with wealth and power constitutes moral approval of them. A little attention shows us the difference between our sentiments towards wealth and those towards virtue; we corrupt our moral sentiments if we do not attend to the difference.⁴³ But Smith’s view about the nature of approval seems to make the confusion he complains of both difficult to avoid and difficult to criticize. In his view, approval of the rich and powerful simply amounts to sympathy with them, as a result of our imagining what we would feel in their situation and the sympathetic feeling that we have towards that imagined feeling. According to his view of approval, then, we approve of the rich. If our tendency to imagine ourselves enjoying being a film star is unavoidable, our tendency to approve the life of a film star must also be unavoidable; and so the ‘corruption’ of our moral sentiments is unavoidable as well. 
- also be unavoidable; and so the ‘corruption’ of our moral sentiments is unavoidable as well. Smith’s example illustrates the irrationality of some sentiments that are founded on my imagining my sentiments in the agent’s situation. If I am poor, I may correctly believe that if I were rich I would be in a position to satisfy all the desires that I have now, and so I may correctly infer that if I were rich and had all and only my present desires, I would make myself happy. I would be wrong, however, to infer that if I were rich I would be happy; for if I were rich, my desires would also have changed from my present desires, and being rich might not be enough to satisfy the desires I would have then.⁴⁴ My error in assuming that a rich person is happy illustrates the error in forming my attitude to someone else’s situation by imagining my counterfactual attitudes in the other person’s situation. 
- Smith’s account of desert rests on his account of approval. In his view, we attribute desert to those towards whom we approve gratitude or resentment.⁴⁵ Since approval is sympathy, understood as similarity of sentiment, the sense of desert must also be explained by reference to sympathy. Approval of punishment, therefore, must be a sympathetic feeling towards those who feel resentment towards the offender. If we share the gratitude of the recipients when we imagine ourselves in their situation, we approve of their reaction, and thereby take the agent to deserve reward. This account seems to be open to counter-examples. If a gangster pleases his wife by giving her an expensive car that he has bought with the money gained by fraud, we might be moved by the gratitude of the wife so that we tend to sympathize with it (in Smith’s sense). But might we not still disapprove of the gangster and of his action, and take it to deserve punishment rather than reward? Smith deals with some counter-examples of this sort by insisting that a judgment about desert requires not only approval of the consequences of the action, but also of the motives of the agent. It is not enough, therefore, to sympathize with the wife’s gratitude; we must also approve of the gangster’s motive in giving his wife the car. In this case, Smith might argue, we disapprove of the gangster’s criminal motive, because we sympathize with the resentment of his victims. This resort to the agent’s motive, however, does not answer the basic objection to Smith’s analysis. The gangster’s motive is dishonest (since he does not mind buying presents for his wife with the profits of his criminal activities), but nonetheless benevolent towards a particular person. If the bad effects of his criminal actions on other people are relatively indirect (he engages in fraud, but not in murder), we might find it hard not to share the favourable sentiment of his wife (or other beneficiaries of his largesse), and hard to share the imagined resentment of his victims (who might not even know they are being cheated and so might not be resentful). In that case our reaction to his motive, according to Smith’s account of approval, is approval, and so we must regard him as deserving of reward. 
- His remarks about the propriety of the agent’s motive do not allow judgments of desert to depart from sympathetic reactions. But since our judgments seem to depart from sympathetic reactions, his account does not capture judgments of desert.     
- The weakness of Smith’s account appears in judgments of desert in cases where the agent has killed an innocent victim. Smith has to rely on his previous account of sympathy with the plight of the dead (ii 1.2.5, 70–1). If A has made B suffer, we have some genuine suffering in B to sympathize with, but if A has killed B, B is no longer (we may assume) suffering. Hence we have to imagine the suffering we would feel if we were both dead and subject to the pains we would suffer if we were alive and were (say) being dismembered. Since we attribute this suffering to the dead B, we also attribute to B the resentment that we imagine B feeling, even though we believe B feels nothing of the sort. This explanation of approval through sympathy commits Smith to the view that our belief that A deserves punishment is based on a true belief about B’s suffering if B is alive, but on a false belief if B is dead. Why should we not suppose, then, that A is more deserving of punishment if A does not kill B than if A kills B? For since it is easier to sympathize with B if we know B is alive and suffering than if we believe B is dead and incapable of suffering, we apparently ought to sympathize with B more if we believe B is alive than if we believe B is dead. This would be a strange conclusion about desert. Smith implies that our attitude towards the dead is based on a basically inconsistent and irrational exercise of imagination. If we believe our attitudes are consistent and rational, we cannot accept Smith’s analysis of approval. 
- So far we have ignored Smith’s restriction of the people whose sympathetic reactions count for determining desert. Sometimes he attributes the relevant sympathetic reactions to ‘every reasonable man’, and to ‘everybody who knows of it’ (ii 1.2.3, 70), as though these were the same people. Unless everyone, or every reasonable person, sympathizes with the gratitude of the gangster’s wife, we cannot say that the gangster deserves reward. But how can we tell whether everyone sympathizes with a particular reaction? The sympathetic reactions of other people who know about an offence may vary in accordance with the different beliefs and emotions of these people. Why ought we to follow the reactions of everyone, as Smith suggests, or even of most people? Why not follow the reactions of the people we most often have to deal with, even if other people react differently? Perhaps Smith is not really thinking of everyone’s reaction, but only of the reaction of an impartial spectator. Instead of considering most people, or a specifci group of people, perhaps we should consider the reactions of a spectator whose personal concerns and interests are not directly involved with those of the agent or the victim. But this appeal to the impartial spectator does not help us to determine our own reaction. Some spectators who are impartial in this sense may be callous, while others may be especially susceptible to certain kinds of appeals to their emotions. These different impartial spectators will react differently; hence they do not provide a guide for our reactions. 
- - We suppose that our approval of other people rests on a general principle about their good or bad intentions; it seems unfair to blame one person more than another if their intentions are the same.⁴⁸ But in fact our judgments about praise and blame violate this principle; for some of our reactions do not simply reflect our views about the agents’ will and intentions, but are also affected by the outcomes of their intentions. We think more highly (say) of the Duke of Wellington than of some other general who was just as able, but who happened to live in a time of peace between Britain and its neighbours, and we think more highly of Dietrich Bonhoeffer than we think of some other Christian who was just as brave, but who did not live under a tyranny. Similarly, we punish attempted murder less severely than successful attempts, even though the intention to murder may have been just the same. Smith suggests that his analysis explains why we violate a maxim that we profess to accept. In his view, our tendency to deviate from the maxim that ties praise to intention supports a sentimentalist account of approval, and refutes an account relying on unreduced evaluative judgment. If evaluative judgment determined our approval, we would not deviate from the judgment about praise and intention as often as we actually do. But if shared sentiments determine approval, the ‘irregularity’ (as Smith calls it, ii 3.introd.6, 93) of our judgments is intelligible. For when we think of Wellington’s successes, our sympathy is engaged, and influences our readiness to praise him; We need not draw this conclusion. Instead we might doubt Smith’s claim that we accept the simple maxim that he mentions. Reflexion on the cases he mentions suggests that ‘approbation or disapprobation of any kind, which can justly be bestowed on any action’ does not depend entirely on the agent’s intention. We might, for instance, distinguish approval of the agent from approval of the agent’s actions. We might also suggest some discrimination between different types of approval of the agent for different things; judgments about the character of agents might not always accord with judgments about what should be done to agents on the basis of their actions. We might also want to separate questions about whether praise and blame are justifeid from questions about when it is appropriate to express praise and blame, or appropriate to express them through the state’s mechanisms of reward and punishment. Once we consider action by the state to enforce judgments of merit or demerit, we introduce many epistemic and practical questions that may reasonably affect the application of our evaluative judgments. hese cases need not result from ‘irregularity of sentiments’. They may be reasonable exceptions to, or qualifciations of, the rule of measuring approval and disapproval by intention. We can see that they are not random or ad hoc exceptions if we consider why they are reasonable provisions. The relevant kinds of approval reflect evaluative judgment rather than irregular sentiments. If we rely on evaluative judgments, they may guide us to a change of mind about whether a given exception to the rule about intentions is reasonable. As Reid remarks, we learn to distinguish the reactions that are appropriate for responsible agents from those that are not.⁵⁰ Children may be angry at tools or animals because they are frustrated or disappointed, and in some circumstances it is difficult for any of us to separate frustration, disappointment, grief, envy, spite, and related emotions from the appropriate reactions to responsible agents. This may explain our failure to distinguish the different degrees of responsibility underlying manslaughter and murder. In such cases, we may agree with Smith’s view that our judgments are influenced by sentiments that are strictly irrelevant to judgments of responsibility. But if we can form judgments that diverge from our sentiments, these judgments are not simply the products of our sentiments. If we have formed these judgments, but our sentiments have not changed to match them, we may find that we do not approve of our sentiments because they do not match our judgments. Approval, therefore, does not consist simply in sharing sentiments. 
- Smith does not want his claims about the impartial spectator to suggest to us that all we really care about, or ought to care about, is approval and praise by others.⁵¹ He recognizes that we care about deserving the praise of others and ourselves, not simply about being praised, and he approves of this concern with praiseworthiness.⁵² How does desire for praiseworthiness, in contrast to mere praise, fti Smith’s views about sympathy and approval? In his view, our approval is directed towards the character and conduct of others (iii 2.3, 114). When we begin to sympathize with the character and conduct that they sympathize with, we care about having this character and conduct. To identify the appropriate character, we must look at ourselves from the point of view of others.⁵³ The actual praise of other people confirms that we have been right in our belief about what is praiseworthy, and so it is welcome to us for that reason; but it is praiseworthiness that primarily concerns us. When I sympathize with the sentiments of others, I sympathize with their sentiments as including some belief about the object of their sentiments. If you are gratified by the company of a friend, your pleasure is pleasure in the company of a genuine friend, not in someone who is pretending to be your friend. And so, if I sympathize with your reactions, and I want to be the sort of person you sympathize with, I will approve of being a genuine friend rather than a pretender. Hence if I want the character and conduct that other people sympathize with and praise, I want to be that sort of person, not simply to be praised. In this case my sympathy includes the intentional object (a real friend, a genuinely generous person) of their sympathy. But Smith does not make it is clear why sympathy with others must extend to the intentional object of their sympathy. People also approve of people who in fact appear to be friends but are not real friends (though they do not approve of them under this description), and so we must apparently sympathize with this reaction to undetected pretenders. If, then, we sympathize with those whom other people sympathize with, why should we not want to be undetected pretenders? It is not obvious from Smith’s account why sympathy must lead an impartial spectator to approve of the genuine character rather than the undetected pretender. Smith concedes this point. He does not maintain that we have some reason to prefer praiseworthiness over praise. He takes it to be a brute fact that we prefer it. The desire to be praiseworthy is more benefciial to society than the simple desire to be praised would be, but individuals themselves are not moved by the good of society; their preference rests on no further reason.⁵⁴ If people generally prefer praiseworthiness over praise, what is it that they prefer? We might assume that a praiseworthy action or trait is one that deserves to be praised whether or not it is praised; this is the conception of the honestum that Price derives from Cicero.⁵⁵ If we assume this, we assume that other people may be mistaken in the kinds of traits that they select for praise. If we want to be praised for being praiseworthy, we want to be praised for the traits that people ought to praise. Sometimes Smith seems to accept this evaluative conception of praiseworthiness; he describes it by reference to ‘what, we imagine, ought to be the judgment of others’ and to a ‘fair and impartial spectator’.⁵⁶ We might suppose that Smith attributes to us a moral judgment about what the spectator ought to judge or about what a fair person would judge. If that were what he meant, reference to the impartial spectator would not give a reductive analysis of moral judgment, since a moral judgment would be part of the analysis. Smith, however, sometimes presents a reductive analysis. He suggests that we find satisfaction in knowing that we are praiseworthy because we possess the qualities that other people praise, whether or not they actually praise us for having them.⁵⁷ If, therefore, people normally select (say) aggressiveness for praise, and they praise me because they mistakenly believe I am aggressive, then, according to Smith, aggressiveness is praiseworthy, but I am praised without being praiseworthy. He does not ask whether people ought to praise or to condemn aggressiveness. Nor does he give us any grounds for deciding this question one way or the other. Hence he distinguishes:
    - (1) being praised
    - (2) being praiseworthy - His analysis of praiseworthiness is non-normative insofar as it mentions only what people praise and would praise, not what they ought to praise
by distinguishing :
    - what people actually praise on a particular occasion, given their beliefs about this occasion, from 
    - what they intend to praise. 
- Is Smith’s account of the impartial spectator equally non-normative? He distinguishes three points of view: 
    - The actual views of other people. 
    - The outlook of an individual and fallible spectator, ‘the supposed impartial and well-informed spectator . . . the man within the breast, the great judge and arbiter of their conduct’ - We need to distinguish the second from the third point of view, because the ‘man within the breast’ is not always a properly impartial spectator. He does not always keep his attention firmly on the praiseworthy, but is sometimes infulenced by the actual praise and blame of other people, and so he sometimes identifeis the praiseworthy with what is actually praised.
    - The outlook of a properly impartial spectator who is free of these errors. - In contrast to this judge who is easily confused by what people actually praise, the properly impartial spectator concentrates on the praiseworthy. The properly impartial spectator approves of the traits that people praise in general and intend to praise in particular cases. Even if generosity is one of the traits that we praise, we may nonetheless praise Croesus for generosity even though he is not really generous; we are taken in by the scale of his charitable contributions and we overlook the fact that he contributes only to causes that advance his own schemes. The truly impartial spectator would not be dazzled by Croesus’ multi-millions in gifts, but would see that Croesus really lacks the trait that we praise. Similarly, he would notice that the widow giving her mite is really generous; he would not be misled by the small size of her gift. In this respect, he approves of praiseworthy traits, but not necessarily of traits that on particular occasions are praised by misguided people. Nonetheless, Smith’s account of the properly impartial spectator is basically nonnormative. This spectator does not ask himself whether the traits that people generally praise really ought to be praised. He corrects ignorant and weak people who are easily misled about whether someone is really generous. But he does not ask himself if people are generally ignorant or weak in their selection of qualities for praise. He identifies the qualities that people intend to praise, but does not ask whether these qualities ought to be praised. If the moral point of view asks whether these qualities ought to be praised, Smith’s impartial spectator does not take the moral point of view. 
- The limitations in the normative judgments of the impartial spectator raise difficulties for Smith’s account of conscience. He identifies approval by one’s own conscience with ‘the testimony of the supposed impartial spectator’ (iii 3.1), and he compares the impartial point of view of conscience, correcting our initial view of our actions, with the perceptual point of view that corrects our initial distorting perspective.⁵⁹ This comparison, however, raises a question that Smith does not clearly answer. If Smith means that the impartial point of view is good at detecting what is really right, he needs some argument. It is not obvious that a true prediction of the sentiments of an impartial spectator is a correct judgment of what is really right.⁶⁰ 
- According to Butler, conscience is a superior principle that claims authority; it claims to judge by ‘rational’ rather than ‘animal’ strength (as Reid puts it). Smith cannot allow this division between rational and animal strength; his conception of approval dissolves rational strength into animal strength. To approve of someone else’s sentiments is to share those sentiments, not to judge that the other person is right. Hence, approval by the impartial spectator must be a sentiment evoked by consideration of the reactions of different people. If approval is a rational judgment about the rightness or wrongness of an action, we might have good reason to stick to it despite other people’s disagreement, if we are right to distrust their judgment. But if we take Smith’s view, we cannot understand conscience in this way, and therefore we cannot explain why it might be right to disagree with other people’s views. Smith’s attempt to capture Butler’s claims about conscience within his own conception of approval is no more successful than Hutcheson’s attempt to capture them within his conception of the moral sense.⁶¹ 
- The moral limitations of the impartial spectator cast doubt on Smith’s implicit answer to Balguy’s attack on Hutcheson’s sentimentalism. According to Balguy, sentimentalism is open to the objections about mutability that Cudworth urges against Hobbes. In Reid’s view, Smith is also open to these objections.⁶⁸ If a true moral judgment is a true prediction of the reactions of an impartial spectator, a change in these reactions would make different moral judgments true, and hence would change what is morally right. But we do not believe that if impartial spectators became more callous, or more rational (so that they ceased to sympathize with dead people), moral rightness and wrongness would change too. Smith, therefore, does not answer all Balguy’s objections to Hutcheson’s attempt to explain praiseworthiness by reference to actual praise. He does not avoid the main charge of eliminating judgments about desert in favour of predictive judgments.⁶⁹ 
- On the main issues about moral reasons and obligation Smith does not advance beyond Hutcheson and Hume. His account of the moral sentiments is more accurate, subtle, and complex than anything they offer. But if we are convinced by the main rationalist objections to Hutcheson and Hume, Smith ought not to change our mind. Balguy, Price, and Reid argue convincingly that a sentimentalist analysis does not capture moral judgment. 
- The self-regarding virtues help Smith to illustrate his point. We value superior reason and understanding for their own sakes, apart from any practical advantage. Similarly, the impartial spectator admires self-command, because he is less prone than we are to be moved by short-term desires.⁷⁴ Smith relies on his dubious assimilation of approval to fellow-feeling, arguing from the fact that the spectator does not feel the solicitations of our present appetites to the conclusion that he does not approve of our acting on them. The argument is open to question; for though the spectator does not feel our affection to our immediate family either, he approves of it. Still, Smith’s observation suggests a reasonable point closely connected to his previous point about our admiration for superior reason apart from its consequences. The reasonable spectator approves of practical reason for its own sake, and therefore admires the operation of practical reason in someone else’s life, apart from any judgment about whether it is useful to the agent all things considered. 
- Though Smith believes that the cosmic aspect of Stoicism explains Stoic indifference, his account introduces a conflict into the Stoic position. For indifference, in his view, rests on the conception of happiness as tranquillity; and it is not clear how tranquillity is consistent with the Stoics’ admitted concern to keep their own character in harmony with cosmic providence. This concern must surely cost them some anxiety, at least before they become sages. For it is not always easy to find the virtuous course of action, or to stick to it in the face of other apparently attractive options. If tranquillity were really our overriding concern, it is not clear why we should attach such importance to our co-operation with providence by becoming virtuous. If we pursue virtue only for the sake of tranquillity, it does not seem the most effective means to that result. These claims express Smith’s views about happiness, not the Stoics’ views. 
- If we become aware of (say) the utilitarian tendencies of some moral sentiments, we have no moral obligation, from Smith’s point of view, to modify our other sentiments to fulfil utilitarian goals; but we also have no reason not to modify them. If, on the other hand, we could not see the hand of ‘Nature’ in our moral sentiments, should this make any difference to our view of them? Smith’s moral theory obliges him to answer No. But the fact that he forestalls the question by assuring us that Nature organizes our sentiments for utilitarian ends suggests that he allows a moral question that his theory ought to disallow. 
- ome questions about the relation between a purely psychological attitude and a critical attitude to moral sentiments converge in Smith’s treatment of the accumulation of wealth and other non-moral goods. He agrees with the Stoics that these are not necessary for happiness, because he imputes to the Stoics his own conception of happiness as contentment and tranquillity. He believes that we sympathize with the rich and powerful because we imagine how happy we would be if we were in their position, and we do not take account of the different desires that we would have if we were in their position (i 3.2.2, 52). Our sympathy is irrational, insofar as it is based on a false supposition, but it is nonetheless socially important.⁸⁵ Our deferential tendencies are useful for the order of society, but they go beyond the limits that can be justified by appeal to their utility. But Smith does not advise us to try to replace these deferential tendencies with a degree of subordination that might be more justifaible and might avoid the bad effects of the deferential tendencies. In appealing to ‘Nature’ he suggests that it would be hazardous to interfere with our sentiments; but in this case it is at least not obvious that ‘Nature’ maintains the ‘wise order’ that he attributes to it elsewhere. 
- mith’s comments on the psychological basis of accumulation illustrate the ways in which he nearly transforms moral philosophy into a purely descriptive social science, and the ways in which he falls short of that result. If moral philosophy describes, and does not attempt to justify, our moral sentiments, we have no room to argue that the sentiments favouring accumulation are unjustified. Smith is simply telling us how accumulation happens and why we favour it; he denies that we have any philosophical room to stand back and ask whether we ought to favour it. If moral philosophy confines itself to describing our moral sentiments, and recognizes no further normative task of arguing that our sentiments are justified or unjustified, it becomes a purely descriptive social science. Hume suggests such a conception of moral philosophy; Smith executes it in some detail. 
- Still, he does not avoid all questions about justification; nature enters to reassure us about the overall results of our moral sentiments. Smith does not always assume that the natural process or result is the morally desirable one; he recognizes that the natural habit of deference goes further than we might prefer it to go. But at crucial points in his argument he combines his purely descriptive account of the operations of our moral sentiments with an appeal to the utilitarianism of nature. Even within a theory that leaves no room for an external critical perspective on our moral sentiments, Smith seems to acknowledge that we look for such a perspective.
