- Ascribe to the Stoics the view that gaining external goods is a game of skill of reasoning for virtuous people. On this basis Adam Smith ascribes an adaptive conception of happiness to the Stoics.
- Sentimentalism is true: the extent to which we are capable of sympathy defines the extent of concern.
- The assertion that meta-ethical conclusions are practically unimportant is part of Smith’s defence of sentimentalism. Some opponents of sentimentalism claim that it undermines morality. Hume answers that the debate between sentimentalism and rationalism concerns a question of purely theoretical interest, so that a decision in favour of sentimentalism could not tend to undermine morality. Smith adds nothing to Hume on this point.
- He believes that moral judgment must be traced back to sentiments, because he agrees with Hutcheson and Hume in believing that moral distinctions are not derived from reason.
Like Hutcheson, he accepts some of the rationalist critique of Hobbes, but he believes that Hutcheson has shown that the true points in this critique do not require the acceptance of rationalism. He agrees with Cudworth’s argument against Hobbes’s positivism, but he believes that Cudworth was wrong to assume that the moral principles prior to law are rational principles. Cudworth’s error was excusable, since in his time no option besides reason had been considered.³ But Hutcheson made the further advances in the science of human nature that settle the issue about reason.⁴ In Smith’s view, Hutcheson’s discussion of the role of reason shows how we can accept what is sound in Cudworth’s criticism of Hobbes without embracing rationalism.⁵
- If Smith is right to agree with Hutcheson against the rationalists, Balguy is wrong to suppose that Cudworth’s argument against Hobbes’s legal positivism also undermines Hutcheson’s sentimentalism. In that case, rationalist arguments against voluntarism and positivism do not apply to sentimentalism. Hutcheson argues, against Balguy, that he allows the corrigibility of the moral sense. He relies on the parallel with the external senses, and hence allows the correction of one person’s sense by reference to the normal perceiver, where ‘normal’ is understood not normatively but statistically. According to Hutcheson, this degree of corrigibility allows us to reject Hobbesian positivism without embracing rationalism.
Balguy replies that Hutcheson’s account of corrigibility does not answer the case against Hobbes. For if moral judgments allow only the sort of correction that Hutcheson describes, we can adjust them to the normal judge’s reactions, but we cannot criticize the normal moral judge. But morality (in Balguy’s view) is not mutable in relation to the reactions of the normal judge. According to Balguy and Price, we regard the moral sense as correct only if it corresponds to some principles of right and wrong that are independent of it; that is Cudworth’s reply to Hobbes’s appeal to law as the basis of right.
- Though Smith agrees with Hutcheson and Hume in rejecting rationalism, he rejects their arguments for tracing moral judgments to a moral sense. In his view, Hutcheson introduced a moral sense because he had correctly eliminated reason and self-love as the source of moral judgments, but could not find their source in any other recognized mental capacity;
hence he needed some new capacity. He called it the moral sense because he took it to be somewhat analogous to the external senses, and also somewhat analogous to the ‘reflex senses’ whose operations result from the operations of other senses
- Smith criticizes Hutcheson on three grounds:
    - We make moral judgments about our moral sentiments themselves. The first line of criticism is reasonable. It exploits Balguy’s objection that the moral sense is corrigible because we apply moral criticism to someone’s moral sentiments, on the assumption that they are capable of improvement, and that they reflect moral credit or discredit on a person (vii 3.3.8–10, 322–4). Hutcheson tries to explain some criticisms of a particular agent’s moral sense, by reference to the moral sense of the ‘normal’ observer. But if ‘normal’ just means ‘statistically most frequent’, he does not answer Balguy’s objection.
Smith implicitly agrees with Balguy; for if Hutcheson’s appeal to the normal observer refuted Balguy, it would refute Smith too
    - Moral judgments are too various to be expressions of a single sentiment or emotion. The second objection to an appeal to the moral sense is more relevant to Hume than to Hutcheson. Though Hume follows Hutcheson in appealing to a moral sense, he does not rely as strongly on an analogy with the other senses. Often he speaks of a certain kind of feeling. Smith is right to suppose that—given Hume’s view of feelings—this account of moral judgment requires the relevant feeling to be introspectively similar in all moral judgments.¹³ If we were to claim that the identity of the moral sentiment consists in the judgment on which it is based, we would no longer make the moral sense primary; hence Hume assumes that introspective similarity is the common feature of all expressions of the moral sense.¹⁴ Against this assumption Smith points out that the sentiments connected with approval of different kinds of actions and characters vary with the objects of our approval.
They have no specific feeling in common 
    - Even if we exclude reason and self-interest, other recognized mental capacities can explain moral judgments, and so we do not need a new one. These two objections prepare for the third objection, which rests on a positive account of moral judgment. Smith rejects any appeal to a distinct moral sense. He regards this notion as an unnecessary innovation.¹⁶ His account of moral judgment is intended to show that the relevant features of moral judgment can be explained without reference to a special sense.
In his view, the relevant facts about moral judgment are to be explained by the operation of sympathy. The feeling connected with moral approval varies according to our sympathetic reaction to the trait of character that we approve of.¹⁷ Moreover, we approve of proper approval by another, and disapprove of improper approval. In this case our moral attitude is to be understood as coincidence or opposition between our sentiments and those of the other person. Why, he asks, should the same not be true in every case
- In these arguments Smith does not draw the extreme conclusion that no sort of sentiment is essential to moral judgment. He believes that the common feature of moral judgments is not the similarity of sentiment, considered in its own right, but the fact that we find the same relation of our own sentiment to the sentiment of another. The common feature is the operation of sympathy.
In opposition to the moral sense theory, Smith claims that the different operations of sympathy give an account of moral judgments.¹⁸ The successive stages in our reactions help us to answer both of the main questions of ethical theory, about which traits are virtues, and about how we judge that they are. A trait is a virtue insofar as it arouses sympathy from different points of view; and we judge that a trait is a virtue insofar as we react to it sympathetically. The close connexion between Smith’s answers to these two questions raises even more doubts about his claim that the first is practically important and the second is not. 
- Though Smith criticizes Hutcheson and Hume for introducing a moral sense, he agrees with their aim of finding a reductive account of moral judgment. His description of the moral sentiments is intended to capture the content and nature of moral judgments. Hence his account is open to objection if the sentiments he describes are either insufficient or unnecessary for some clear cases of apparent moral judgment. 
- Smith sometimes recognizes the appropriate counterfactual basis for fellow-feeling. He sees that sympathy requires not that I consider myself with my feelings in your situation, but I consider myself being you and having the feelings that you have or would have. 
- But even the more plausible account of the counterfactual basis of sympathy does not seem to cover all cases of appropriate sympathy. Smith recognizes some cases in which sympathy seems appropriate, but seems not to be based on my imagining what you feel:
    - We feel anguish at the sight of people who have lost their reason, even if they seem quite cheerful about it. The counterfactual suppositions on which this anguish is based are inconsistent; I suppose myself suffering terribly if I were aware of myself in that situation, though at the same time I suppose that if I were in that situation I would not be aware of it, and hence would not suffer.²² 
    - A mother feels agony for her child suffering from a disease, even though the child cannot have the fears for the future that explain the mother’s anxiety.
    - We feel sorry for the dead because we imagine ourselves both being dead (and so having no consciousness) and being aware of being dead (and so being conscious).²³ 
- To see why such reactions (mother that feels sympathy to a dideased child and our sympathy to a crazy people) are appropriate, we should distinguish two kinds of ‘fellow-feeling’. 
    - One kind is a passion in us that corresponds to a passion in the other person.
This is the reaction advised by St Paul in ‘Rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep’.²⁴ 
    - Another kind is a passion in us that is directed to the other person’s situation. Smith recognizes these two passions, but he tries to explain the second by reference to the first, by introducing counterfactual passions that are reproduced in actual passions. 
- The difference between passions based on evaluative judgments and passions based on counterfactual passions (described above) can be seen more clearly in cases where the two kinds of passions conflict. Suppose that A sees B taking cruel pleasure in causing pain to C, and that A knows both that A also tends to enjoy the pleasures that a cruel person would enjoy and that A is insensitive to pain. Smith’s analysis requires A to reflect: ‘If I were in B’s situation, I would enjoy causing pain to C, and if I were in C’s situation, I would not care much about the pain I suffered from B’. According to Smith, then, A will have fellow-feeling for B rather than C. But if A is a moderately good person, this analysis does not fit; for A recognizes that these features of A are not a good reason for denying that B is doing unjustified harm to C.
Hence A’s sympathy for C rests on A’s judgments about the badness of B’s cruelty and the severity of C’s suffering, not on the feelings that A would have in B’s and C’s situation. If A is a moderately good person, these evaluative judgments cause A to sympathize with C, not with B. 
- This explanation of one kind of sympathy conflicts with one of Smith’s main aims. For the explanation takes sympathy to rest on prior evaluative judgments, contrary to Smith’s aim of explaining evaluative judgments through the operation of sympathy. His reductive account of evaluative judgments does not capture the range of morally appropriate reactions. If his account implies that some morally appropriate actions rest on contradictory assumptions or illusions, the account is open to doubt. Perhaps the doubt is not decisive; we may decide that the illusory character of the suppositions underlying a reaction does not affect the moral appropriateness of the reaction itself. But before we decide this, we may reasonably ask whether Smith’s account is so plausible that we have to accept its less appealing implications. 









# Difficulties

- About his view of Stoics: If virtue is happiness, and therefore is the only end of our appropriate actions, virtuous people make an appropriate attempt to protect a child from danger for the sake of their own virtue. They do not aim at the child’s safety, but at the exercise of their virtue in the attempt. It does not seem arbitrary that virtuous people display their practical reason and their fearlessness in defending their community rather than in a daring bank robbery.
- Smith does not comment on this disagreement between Hutcheson and Hume about the ‘positive and arbitrary’ character of the moral sense (as Balguy puts it). But their disagreement raises another question about practical significance. If we agree with Hume that we have no rational or moral basis for critical evaluation of our moral sense, we may not take morality as seriously as we would take it if we thought we had the sort of critical basis that the rationalists suppose we have. Hume concedes this point to the rationalists.
Hutcheson and Smith do not; but Smith does not say what is wrong with Hume’s argument against Hutcheson. 
- Smith, however, is warm in the cause of virtue; he does not suggest that reflexion on the nature of moral virtue or of moral judgment will or should lead us to take morality less seriously or to be less warm in its defence. He returns to Hutcheson’s position, but he gives no reason for preferring it to Hume’s position. 
- we cannot (he assumes) accept Balguy’s arguments as good reasons for favouring rationalism; for we already have decisive reasons for accepting sentimentalism.
But Smith’s reasons for confidence in sentimentalism are open to doubt. His main ground for rejecting rationalism about moral distinctions seems to be his acceptance of a version of internalism about virtue and motivation. In his view, virtue necessarily pleases us, but this effect would not be necessary if our judgment that something is a virtue were a purely rational judgment. If the judgment were purely rational, it would be a contingent fact that virtue pleases some people and displeases others. But since it would be self-contradictory to judge that something is virtuous and not to find it pleasing, moral judgment must include feeling.⁹
- Smith would be on stronger ground if he appealed to a different anti-rationalist argument, more clearly presented by Hume than by Hutcheson. According to this argument, reason itself cannot discover appropriate ends, but can only discover instrumental means to ends, and hence cannot be a source of ultimate justifying reasons. If virtues are sources of ultimate justifying reasons, reason cannot discover the virtues. The virtuous person, according to Hutcheson, regards the good of other people as worth pursuing for its own sake; but we cannot discover by reason that the good of others is worth pursuing for its own sake; and so the virtuous concern must result from something other than a discovery of reason. Reid exposes a weakness in this argument for sentimentalism: even if virtue involves a specific belief about ultimate ends, and even if this belief cannot be further justified, it does not follow that it is a sentiment.¹¹

- Smith advances this discussion through a fuller constructive account of the moral sentiments than Hume offers. He supports the sentimentalist position by describing sentiments that we might plausibly regard as the basis of our moral judgments. If he offers a descriptively adequate account that traces our various moral judgments to their sources in sentiments, he shows that sentimentalism fits the actual range and variety of moral judgments.
