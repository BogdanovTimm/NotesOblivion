- Ascribe to the Stoics the view that gaining external goods is a game of skill of reasoning for virtuous people. On this basis Adam Smith ascribes an adaptive conception of happiness to the Stoics.
- Sentimentalism is true: the extent to which we are capable of sympathy defines the extent of concern.
- The assertion that meta-ethical conclusions are practically unimportant is part of Smith’s defence of sentimentalism. Some opponents of sentimentalism claim that it undermines morality. Hume answers that the debate between sentimentalism and rationalism concerns a question of purely theoretical interest, so that a decision in favour of sentimentalism could not tend to undermine morality. Smith adds nothing to Hume on this point.
- He believes that moral judgment must be traced back to sentiments, because he agrees with Hutcheson and Hume in believing that moral distinctions are not derived from reason.
Like Hutcheson, he accepts some of the rationalist critique of Hobbes, but he believes that Hutcheson has shown that the true points in this critique do not require the acceptance of rationalism. He agrees with Cudworth’s argument against Hobbes’s positivism, but he believes that Cudworth was wrong to assume that the moral principles prior to law are rational principles. Cudworth’s error was excusable, since in his time no option besides reason had been considered.³ But Hutcheson made the further advances in the science of human nature that settle the issue about reason.⁴ In Smith’s view, Hutcheson’s discussion of the role of reason shows how we can accept what is sound in Cudworth’s criticism of Hobbes without embracing rationalism.⁵
- If Smith is right to agree with Hutcheson against the rationalists, Balguy is wrong to suppose that Cudworth’s argument against Hobbes’s legal positivism also undermines Hutcheson’s sentimentalism. In that case, rationalist arguments against voluntarism and positivism do not apply to sentimentalism. Hutcheson argues, against Balguy, that he allows the corrigibility of the moral sense. He relies on the parallel with the external senses, and hence allows the correction of one person’s sense by reference to the normal perceiver, where ‘normal’ is understood not normatively but statistically. According to Hutcheson, this degree of corrigibility allows us to reject Hobbesian positivism without embracing rationalism.
Balguy replies that Hutcheson’s account of corrigibility does not answer the case against Hobbes. For if moral judgments allow only the sort of correction that Hutcheson describes, we can adjust them to the normal judge’s reactions, but we cannot criticize the normal moral judge. But morality (in Balguy’s view) is not mutable in relation to the reactions of the normal judge. According to Balguy and Price, we regard the moral sense as correct only if it corresponds to some principles of right and wrong that are independent of it; that is Cudworth’s reply to Hobbes’s appeal to law as the basis of right.
- Though Smith agrees with Hutcheson and Hume in rejecting rationalism, he rejects their arguments for tracing moral judgments to a moral sense. In his view, Hutcheson introduced 









# Difficulties

- About his view of Stoics: If virtue is happiness, and therefore is the only end of our appropriate actions, virtuous people make an appropriate attempt to protect a child from danger for the sake of their own virtue. They do not aim at the child’s safety, but at the exercise of their virtue in the attempt. It does not seem arbitrary that virtuous people display their practical reason and their fearlessness in defending their community rather than in a daring bank robbery.
- Smith does not comment on this disagreement between Hutcheson and Hume about the ‘positive and arbitrary’ character of the moral sense (as Balguy puts it). But their disagreement raises another question about practical significance. If we agree with Hume that we have no rational or moral basis for critical evaluation of our moral sense, we may not take morality as seriously as we would take it if we thought we had the sort of critical basis that the rationalists suppose we have. Hume concedes this point to the rationalists.
Hutcheson and Smith do not; but Smith does not say what is wrong with Hume’s argument against Hutcheson. 
- Smith, however, is warm in the cause of virtue; he does not suggest that reflexion on the nature of moral virtue or of moral judgment will or should lead us to take morality less seriously or to be less warm in its defence. He returns to Hutcheson’s position, but he gives no reason for preferring it to Hume’s position. 
- we cannot (he assumes) accept Balguy’s arguments as good reasons for favouring rationalism; for we already have decisive reasons for accepting sentimentalism.
But Smith’s reasons for confidence in sentimentalism are open to doubt. His main ground for rejecting rationalism about moral distinctions seems to be his acceptance of a version of internalism about virtue and motivation. In his view, virtue necessarily pleases us, but this effect would not be necessary if our judgment that something is a virtue were a purely rational judgment. If the judgment were purely rational, it would be a contingent fact that virtue pleases some people and displeases others. But since it would be self-contradictory to judge that something is virtuous and not to find it pleasing, moral judgment must include feeling.⁹
- Smith would be on stronger ground if he appealed to a different anti-rationalist argument, more clearly presented by Hume than by Hutcheson. According to this argument, reason itself cannot discover appropriate ends, but can only discover instrumental means to ends, and hence cannot be a source of ultimate justifying reasons. If virtues are sources of ultimate justifying reasons, reason cannot discover the virtues. The virtuous person, according to Hutcheson, regards the good of other people as worth pursuing for its own sake; but we cannot discover by reason that the good of others is worth pursuing for its own sake; and so the virtuous concern must result from something other than a discovery of reason. Reid exposes a weakness in this argument for sentimentalism: even if virtue involves a specific belief about ultimate ends, and even if this belief cannot be further justified, it does not follow that it is a sentiment.¹¹
