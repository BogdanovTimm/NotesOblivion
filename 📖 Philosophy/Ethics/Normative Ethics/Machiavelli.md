- Aquinas intends his account of the ultimate end and the moral virtues to embrace different sorts of practical situations and demands. The virtues satisfy the demands of:
    - self-interest;
    - morality; 
    - the common good of a community; 
    - a human being’s approach to the vision of God. 
Machiavelli rejects Aquinas’ system by arguing that no one set of virtues can satisfy all four sorts of demands.
- Good city is a city that is independent from the external control and that has internal cohision.
- Citizens with right sort of civic virtues want freedrom from interference from state, not only because it secures their private lifes, but also because it is good by itself
- Machiavelli preferfs republic over monarchy and authocwraty
- Good state is maintaining a virtues in its citizens
- The main civic virtue is a preserving a commong good. The second one - the desire for the glory. If common good is in conflict with the desire for the glory - we must seek for the common good.
- Military virtues conflict with the civic ones
- Machiavelly critisize christianity because their virtues makes people weak.
- Good effects of a bad action justifies bad action
- Just like Augustine, Machiavelly sees 2 types of virtues: christian ones and the pagan ones. But Machiavelly disagrees with Augustine about which virtues are to be preffered - Augustine thinks that self-assertion and arrogance is bad, but Machiavelly thinks self-assertion and arrogance are good.
- Machiavelli thinks that ordinary moral virtues are good, but we live in a world in which every our descision occures in an extraordinary situations
- Maybe Machiavelly holds that rulers may not conform to Natural Law, whether simple civil people should conform to Natural Law

# Difficulties
- We have found, however, that Augustine does not hold this view of pagan virtue, and that he is right not to hold it.¹⁵ The virtues advocated by pagan moralists are not forms of self-assertion or arrogance; they include concern for the interests of others for their own sake. Machiavelli’s division between the pagan and the Christian outlook does not fit the views of pagan moralists.
