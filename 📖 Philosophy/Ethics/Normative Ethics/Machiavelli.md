- Aquinas intends his account of the ultimate end and the moral virtues to embrace different sorts of practical situations and demands. The virtues satisfy the demands of:
    - self-interest;
    - morality; 
    - the common good of a community; 
    - a human being’s approach to the vision of God. 
Machiavelli rejects Aquinas’ system by arguing that no one set of virtues can satisfy all four sorts of demands.

- We have found, however, that Augustine does not hold this view of pagan virtue, and that he is right not to hold it.¹⁵ The virtues advocated by pagan moralists are not forms of self-assertion or arrogance; they include concern for the interests of others for their own sake. Machiavelli’s division between the pagan and the Christian outlook does not fit the views of pagan moralists.
