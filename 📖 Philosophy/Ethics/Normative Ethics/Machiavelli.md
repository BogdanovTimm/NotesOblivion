- Aquinas intends his account of the ultimate end and the moral virtues to embrace different sorts of practical situations and demands. The virtues satisfy the demands of:
    - self-interest;
    - morality; 
    - the common good of a community; 
    - a human being’s approach to the vision of God. 
Machiavelli rejects Aquinas’ system by arguing that no one set of virtues can satisfy all four sorts of demands.
