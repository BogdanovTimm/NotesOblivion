- Holistic Naturalism (Human nature os a system of some tendencies of people. But not all tendencies are part of human nature) is false. Hobbes does not believe that all claims about human nature must be excluded from moral philosophy, but he rejects the naturalist position that we have outlined. Everything what people do is a human's nature
- Virtues of character are sufficient to be virtuous
- Psychological egoism is true
- In his view, the difference between simply entertaining a proposition and believing it consists in the degree of vividness with which you entertain it; it is an introspectible property of the idea itself.
- Eudamonism is false
- Defends both compatibilism and anti-intellectualism against Bramhall. 
- freedom consists simply in internal determination; he sees no relevant distinction between the will and the ‘sentiments’ or ‘passions’ as sources of the internal determination.
He rejects both an indeterminist and an intellectualist account of freedom.¹⁸ Though he accepts the voluntarist criticisms of intellectualism far enough to believe that determination by intellect is not freedom, he does not regard voluntarism as an adequate alternative. Against both intellectualists and voluntarists, he concludes that the will is a passion. 
- Ordinary legislators support their commands with sanctions. If God does this too, God can attach pleasure to the fulfilment of divine commands and pain to the violation of them. Since we naturally aim at pleasure and avoid pain, God can change the natural law without changing this aspect of our nature. If, then, we want to maintain the penal account of natural law, we are well advised to accept a hedonist account of the good. Hence Hobbes combines a penal account of natural law with hedonism. In his view, the laws of nature, apart from divine commands, are not really laws, but counsels of prudence prescribing means to our pleasure.
As divine commands they are laws combined with sanctions appealing to pain and pleasure.
The appropriate connexion with human nature relies on a hedonist conception of the good.⁷ 
- Morality works only in a background of peace
- Human nature is not fulfilled by morality
- Morality must be imposed on people to restrain their self-seeking tendencies
- God commands to do what government says
- According to Hobbes, the content of natural law, independent of divine or human legislation, consists of the demands of self-interest
- The Aristotelian dialectical approach to moral inquiry begins from ‘appearances’ and does not confnie itself to evident and indisputable starting points. Hobbes believes that it leads to insoluble and fruitless disputes. 
- He does not believe that this difference between the progress of natural philosophy and the relative backwardness of moral philosophy marks a difference in the subject matter or in the appropriate method. Nor does he draw the sceptical conclusion³ that knowledge of moral questions cannot be found, or the nihilist conclusion that there is no moral reality to be known. He believes that disputes result simply from failure to apply the method of natural philosophy.⁴ We should begin with clear and indisputable axioms about human nature, and avoid the dialectical method that relies on common beliefs.⁵
- He believes that his answers will fall outside the range of answers that have been subjects of controversy in moral philosophy.
- His main objection to his predecessors is not that they disagree with one another, but that their doctrines are dangerous: Mistaken theories of Greek and Latin writers have encouraged citizens to believe that they have rights against their rulers. Citizens claim the right to judge their rulers by standards derived from moral principles, and so they try to replace their rulers by agitation or revolution.
- Hobbes does not share Grotius’ view that the Scholastic doctrines can be largely maintained without endangering civil peace
- Hobbes argues, therefore, that peace is absolutely prior to all other moral considerations; they all presuppose the maintenance of peace, and therefore cannot justify disturbances of the peace.
- He does not, for instance, try to defend the priority of peace by a dialectical argument to show that, on reflexion, we really believe peace matters more than anything else. He does not suggest that if we reach ‘narrow reflective equilibrium’ among our moral and political views, we will accept the supremacy of peace.
- Will is simply the last ‘appetite’ (i.e., desire, appetitus) in deliberation. His account of deliberation assumes that desire is simply anticipatory pleasure or pain, which is the internal movement explaining action (EL 7.1–2). We move towards ends (7.4) that differ in their closeness or distance. We deliberate by being struck in succession by different attractive features of a situation. The strongest appetite that emerges from that process immediately precedes action; this is the will.
- The will is not an intrinsically rational desire aiming at the good rather than the pleasant. Our goal-directed movements, therefore, do not rely on a rational appearance of an overall good (EL 7.5).
- Hobbes believes that non-rational agents also deliberate, so that if will is desire resting on deliberation, it is not confined to rational agents. Non-rational agents also deliberate. They hesitate at the idea of something repellent and advance at the idea of something attractive; hence they deliberate, and act on their wills.  Hence the Scholastic distinction between will and passion is misguided.
- Hobbes does not claim to reject deliberation: This account of deliberation refers only to non-normative states; it does not mention our estimate of the value of the different options that occur to us in deliberation. It does not distinguish our being more attracted to one of two options from our believing that it deserves to be preferred. If we believe (as we suppose) that one option deserves to be preferred, we believe that the reasons for it are better than the reasons for the other option. This aspect of deliberation and will has no place in Hobbes’s account; he does not suggest that our will results from the judgment that one option is better than the other, or from the judgment that we have stronger reasons for pursuing it. Deliberation and will, in his account, result from yielding successively to a sequence of appearances about different options, without any rational assessment of their value.²
- Hobbes' analysis of deliberation implies that the Scholastics are wrong to treat will as a distinctively rational appetite.
- His account for deliberation leaves room for incontinence.









#                  Difficulties

- He claims that deliberation results from the foresight of good or evil consequences, and better deliberation results from the foresight of more consequences.²⁴ He assumes that if we foresee more of the consequences, we take account of their goodness and badness in our deliberation and in any decision that is based on deliberation. But Even if we confine goods to pleasures, we have no reason to assume that in the H-deliberating agent the apparently larger sum of future pleasures always arouses the stronger appetite. We may, for instance, be irrationally indifferent to the remoter future, or irrationally obsessed by it at the expense of shorter-term beneftis, and these irrational tendencies may determine the course of H-deliberation. So, consideration of more consequences may not improve my deliberation
- His remarks about better and worse deliberation rely on a normative conception of deliberation, taking it to consider what is best overall and what we ought to do in the light of what seems best overall. H-deliberation has no room for this normative conception.
- Hobbes can't use Socrates' position from Protagoras, where Socrates claims that we always act to an apparent larger sum future pleasures, because it implies that there is no incontinence, but Hobbes itself claims that there is incontinence.
- He may support his claims about deliberation and overall good by the empirical assumption that we always pursue the greater apparent good; but this empirical assumption conflicts with the possibility of incontinence.
