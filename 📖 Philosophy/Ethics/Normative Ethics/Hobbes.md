- Holistic Naturalism (Human nature os a system of some tendencies of people. But not all tendencies are part of human nature) is false. Hobbes does not believe that all claims about human nature must be excluded from moral philosophy, but he rejects the naturalist position that we have outlined. Everything what people do is a human's nature
- Virtues of character are sufficient to be virtuous
- Psychological egoism is true
- In his view, the difference between simply entertaining a proposition and believing it consists in the degree of vividness with which you entertain it; it is an introspectible property of the idea itself.
- Eudamonism is false
- Defends both compatibilism and anti-intellectualism against Bramhall. 
- freedom consists simply in internal determination; he sees no relevant distinction between the will and the ‘sentiments’ or ‘passions’ as sources of the internal determination.
He rejects both an indeterminist and an intellectualist account of freedom.¹⁸ Though he accepts the voluntarist criticisms of intellectualism far enough to believe that determination by intellect is not freedom, he does not regard voluntarism as an adequate alternative. Against both intellectualists and voluntarists, he concludes that the will is a passion. 
- Ordinary legislators support their commands with sanctions. If God does this too, God can attach pleasure to the fulfilment of divine commands and pain to the violation of them. Since we naturally aim at pleasure and avoid pain, God can change the natural law without changing this aspect of our nature. If, then, we want to maintain the penal account of natural law, we are well advised to accept a hedonist account of the good. Hence Hobbes combines a penal account of natural law with hedonism. In his view, the laws of nature, apart from divine commands, are not really laws, but counsels of prudence prescribing means to our pleasure.
As divine commands they are laws combined with sanctions appealing to pain and pleasure.
The appropriate connexion with human nature relies on a hedonist conception of the good.⁷ 
- Morality works only in a background of peace
- Human nature is not fulfilled by morality
- Morality must be imposed on people to restrain their self-seeking tendencies
- God commands to do what government says
- According to Hobbes, the content of natural law, independent of divine or human legislation, consists of the demands of self-interest
