- Holistic Naturalism (Human nature os a system of some tendencies of people. But not all tendencies are part of human nature) is false. Hobbes does not believe that all claims about human nature must be excluded from moral philosophy, but he rejects the naturalist position that we have outlined. Everything what people do is a human's nature
- Virtues of character are sufficient to be virtuous
- Psychological egoism is true
- In his view, the difference between simply entertaining a proposition and believing it consists in the degree of vividness with which you entertain it; it is an introspectible property of the idea itself.
- Eudamonism is false
- Defends both compatibilism and anti-intellectualism against Bramhall. 
- freedom consists simply in internal determination; he sees no relevant distinction between the will and the ‘sentiments’ or ‘passions’ as sources of the internal determination.
He rejects both an indeterminist and an intellectualist account of freedom.¹⁸ Though he accepts the voluntarist criticisms of intellectualism far enough to believe that determination by intellect is not freedom, he does not regard voluntarism as an adequate alternative. Against both intellectualists and voluntarists, he concludes that the will is a passion. 
- Ordinary legislators support their commands with sanctions. If God does this too, God can attach pleasure to the fulfilment of divine commands and pain to the violation of them. Since we naturally aim at pleasure and avoid pain, God can change the natural law without changing this aspect of our nature. If, then, we want to maintain the penal account of natural law, we are well advised to accept a hedonist account of the good. Hence Hobbes combines a penal account of natural law with hedonism. In his view, the laws of nature, apart from divine commands, are not really laws, but counsels of prudence prescribing means to our pleasure.
As divine commands they are laws combined with sanctions appealing to pain and pleasure.
The appropriate connexion with human nature relies on a hedonist conception of the good.⁷ 
- Morality works only in a background of peace
- Human nature is not fulfilled by morality
- Morality must be imposed on people to restrain their self-seeking tendencies
- God commands to do what government says
- According to Hobbes, the content of natural law, independent of divine or human legislation, consists of the demands of self-interest
- The Aristotelian dialectical approach to moral inquiry begins from ‘appearances’ and does not confnie itself to evident and indisputable starting points. Hobbes believes that it leads to insoluble and fruitless disputes. 
- He does not believe that this difference between the progress of natural philosophy and the relative backwardness of moral philosophy marks a difference in the subject matter or in the appropriate method. Nor does he draw the sceptical conclusion³ that knowledge of moral questions cannot be found, or the nihilist conclusion that there is no moral reality to be known. He believes that disputes result simply from failure to apply the method of natural philosophy.⁴ We should begin with clear and indisputable axioms about human nature, and avoid the dialectical method that relies on common beliefs.⁵
- He believes that his answers will fall outside the range of answers that have been subjects of controversy in moral philosophy.
- His main objection to his predecessors is not that they disagree with one another, but that their doctrines are dangerous: Mistaken theories of Greek and Latin writers have encouraged citizens to believe that they have rights against their rulers. Citizens claim the right to judge their rulers by standards derived from moral principles, and so they try to replace their rulers by agitation or revolution.
- Hobbes does not share Grotius’ view that the Scholastic doctrines can be largely maintained without endangering civil peace
- Hobbes argues, therefore, that peace is absolutely prior to all other moral considerations; they all presuppose the maintenance of peace, and therefore cannot justify disturbances of the peace.
- He does not, for instance, try to defend the priority of peace by a dialectical argument to show that, on reflexion, we really believe peace matters more than anything else. He does not suggest that if we reach ‘narrow reflective equilibrium’ among our moral and political views, we will accept the supremacy of peace.
- Will is simply the last ‘appetite’ (i.e., desire, appetitus) in deliberation. His account of deliberation assumes that desire is simply anticipatory pleasure or pain, which is the internal movement explaining action (EL 7.1–2). We move towards ends (7.4) that differ in their closeness or distance. We deliberate by being struck in succession by different attractive features of a situation. The strongest appetite that emerges from that process immediately precedes action; this is the will.
- The will is not an intrinsically rational desire aiming at the good rather than the pleasant. Our goal-directed movements, therefore, do not rely on a rational appearance of an overall good (EL 7.5).
- Hobbes believes that non-rational agents also deliberate, so that if will is desire resting on deliberation, it is not confined to rational agents. Non-rational agents also deliberate. They hesitate at the idea of something repellent and advance at the idea of something attractive; hence they deliberate, and act on their wills.  Hence the Scholastic distinction between will and passion is misguided.
- Hobbes does not claim to reject deliberation: This account of deliberation refers only to non-normative states; it does not mention our estimate of the value of the different options that occur to us in deliberation. It does not distinguish our being more attracted to one of two options from our believing that it deserves to be preferred. If we believe (as we suppose) that one option deserves to be preferred, we believe that the reasons for it are better than the reasons for the other option. This aspect of deliberation and will has no place in Hobbes’s account; he does not suggest that our will results from the judgment that one option is better than the other, or from the judgment that we have stronger reasons for pursuing it. Deliberation and will, in his account, result from yielding successively to a sequence of appearances about different options, without any rational assessment of their value.²
- Hobbes' analysis of deliberation implies that the Scholastics are wrong to treat will as a distinctively rational appetite.
- His account for deliberation leaves room for incontinence.
- Hobbes rejects Aquinas’ intellectualism - the view that the will is determined by the greater good presented by reason.
- Hobbes is a compatibilist - Against Bramhall's indeterminism, Hobbes defends the compatibilist view that we have attributed to Aquinas, and goes further by accepting soft determinism.
- Hobbes rejects rationalism
- Hobbes rejects indeterminism
- Since he believes in freedom, the relevant sort of freedom is internal determination by desire. If H-deliberation is not deliberation, his inferences about freedom are insecure.
- Deliberation = succession of advances and retreats consisting in desires and aversions.
- Desire = advance towards anticipated pleasure. So, he maintains psychological hedonist egoism as a theory of motives
- The objects of our passions are means to our satisfaction or security
- If I pity someone quite unrelated to me who will not affect my security, I do not believe that this person or what is happening to him actually affects my security. In this case Hobbes believes that I think of what I would feel if my security, for instance, were threatened. In thinking of the counterfactual situation, I actually have some of the feeling that I would have if the situation were actual, and so I have the feeling even when my security is not involved.
-  He believes that the non-egoistic passions (if there are any) motivate us only if they seem to affect our prospects of pleasure and pain
- Hobbes argues that satisfaction or contentment (Epicurean static pleasures), taken as an ultimate end of desire, does not explain why we go on desiring and acting and would not regard the cessation of desire as a welcome outcome (L. 11.1). Hence, we ought not to identify pleasure with Epicurean satisfaction or contentment; we ought to identify it with Epicurean ‘kinetic’ pleasure. We seek means to ‘secure the way of our future desire’. But securing the way of our future desire cannot be our ultimate end; for we do not want to secure the way of our future desire for its own sake.
- There is 3 types of good:
    - beautiful - good in the promise
    - delightful - good as the end desired, good in effect
    - profitable - good as a means
- There is no such good as honestum (other-regarded good)
- If Hobbes is right about the connexion between judgments of goodness and apparent pleasure, judgments about goodness vary not only among different people, but also within a single person at different times.
- practical reason do not find constitutions of the ultimate good and means to it. It simply discovers means to our future-directed desires for pleasure.
- All motives either express a passion or result from deliberation about the means to satisfy a passion.
- A preference for some present good over a greater long-term good is irrational, in Hobbes’s view; it is rational to focus on the long-term rather than the short-term good.
- Reason, therefore, directs us towards the pursuit of our long-term good, which Hobbes identifeis with self-preservation.
- Peace is good only because of people desires. In the state of discord that (according to Hobbes) results from disagreement, everyone’s desires coincide, because everyone sees that strife frustrates their attempts to secure the way of their future desire.
- Peace is a means to satisfying their desires.
- We might reject his simplifying reduction of good to pleasure, on the ground that we make objective judgments about goodness; and do we not need objective judgments in order to fnid a rational moral basis for political society? Hobbes answers that we do not need the sort of objectivity that he denies about goodness. On the contrary, once we recognize the consequences of his subjectivist view, we can see an acceptable substitute for objectivity. The subjectivity of value judgments, given the actual differences between human beings, leads to discord; but discord, given the similarities between human beings, leads to the unanimous desire for peace.
- If we have an overriding desire for self-preservation, we discover the means to it only by reasoning about future goods. If we do not consider the long-term consequences of our action, we frustrate our desire for self-preservation. In the same way we may expect reason to regulate hope and fear; for baseless fear is based on a false supposition about the future, and reason is needed to fnid true or plausible beliefs that guide our fears. Someone who acts on a fear resulting from groundless beliefs about the future acts ‘against reason’ by acting contrary to beliefs about what promotes the satisfaction of the overriding desire for self-preservation, or by failing to consider what promotes the satisfaction of this overriding desire.
- When reason declares peas as something good, this declaration is not categorical, in Kant’s sense, by being independent of human inclinations; it is a hypothetical imperative that applies to actual situations.
- He appeals to pleasure, as the Cyrenaics do, as an alternative to the eudaemonist’s ultimate good. In his view, everything I choose for its own sake is some pleasure of my own, and so must be some self-confnied condition; it must be a state of myself that does not include (though it may causally depend on) a state of someone or something else.
- There is no final good. Moreover, if it would, it will be unsatisfactory, because then we will stop acting.
- Hobbes agrees with Boyle in rejecting agents distinct from God that have their own inherent goal-directed natures. 
- He treats the study of human action as part of the study of ‘motion’. Deliberation and desire should be understood, in his view, as the result of the interplay between motions of varying strengths that determine the motion of the human being as a whole. He regards desire as genuine motion, and attacks those who treat it as merely metaphorical motion 
- Hobbes, then, follows Aristotle in arguing for a conception of the human good from claims about human nature.⁶⁶ He disagrees with Aristotle on the conclusions that can be drawn about the human good from an appeal to human nature. In particular he denies that we can discover anything like an Aristotelian ultimate end. 
- He denies that a human being is naturally social
- He does not believe that the human good consists in a life that realizes human capacities under the control of practical reason. The examination of human capacities and their relations does not help us to discover the virtues. Nor does he claim that the good for a human being essentially includes the good of others, because he cannot rely on the argument about self-realization that leads Aristotle to this conclusion.
- He agrees with Aquinas’ claim that we grasp the principles of natural law by grasping the end to which human nature is naturally inclined. Insofar as he derives an account of the virtues from an account of human nature Hobbes agrees with Aquinas. Hence he identifeis moral philosophy with the science of the laws of nature. The true doctrine of the laws of nature specifies the virtues and vices that are the subject matter of moral philosophy.
- Hobbes believes that natural law rests on the requirements of human nature. On this point he agrees with Aquinas and his successors. But he departs from Aquinas in claiming this law simply prescribes means to self-preservation.
- Everyone till Hobbes (in his opinion) were roughly right about which traits are virtues, but they were wrong about what makes them virtues, not seeing their essential connexion with ‘peaceable, sociable, and comfortable living’.
- Hobbes denies that when we study human nature we discover that human beings have a natural ultimate good that supports an account of the virtues. If he is right, we cannot discover from the examination of human nature and the human good that we have good reason to follow the principles of natural law. It is wrong to believe that some actions are intrinsically right (honesta) by being appropriate for rational nature.
- In Hobbes’s view, human nature is a collection of desires without a system; practical reason, therefore, must simply look for the means to satisfy one’s predominant desire. If our predominant desire is to secure the way of our future desire, we care most about our self-preservation. Practical reason justifeis the laws of nature if it shows that they specify means to self-preservation. This is what Hobbes tries to show about the laws of nature.
- He believes that natural laws impose obligations. He defines obligation by comparing it to rights:
    - Right (liberty) - being free to do something
    - Law (obligation) - being not free to do sometnihg
    - Hobbes does not believe (or at least does not always believe) that our natural right extends to everything that is physically possible in the state of nature. Some remarks (outside Leviathan) about violations of the law of nature in war suggest ways of exceeding our natural rights.
- Physical renunciation of a right is not the same as obligation. In his view, I lay aside my right by renunciation or by transfer, not by actually standing out of your way, but by saying I will stand out of your way.²³ Once I have done this, I am obliged to stand out of your way and I ought to stand out of your way; if I do not stand out of your way, I act without right.
- It is not clear, however, that Hobbes takes the making of a promise all by itself to constitute an obligation. This claim has to be restricted to cases where the promise is not ‘invalid’. The obligation involved here is also prudential, provided that we think in the indirect prudential way that we must adopt in order to explain why the laws of nature are obligatory in foro externo in a commonwealth
- His other remarks do not suggest that it is quite so easy to oblige myself. I oblige myself to you through a valid covenant of mutual trust, involving the future performance by both parties. Such a covenant requires some assurance that the other party will also keep the covenant (L. 15.3). We can acquire this assurance more easily by recognizing that once A has performed A’s part of the covenant, it is reasonable for B to perform B’s part (L. 15.5).²⁶ When both A and B have the appropriate assurance, each obliges himself by signifying his intention to lay aside his right.
- Hobbes throws some light on his view of obligation by connecting it with motivation. In non-physical obligation ‘liberty is taken away . . . by hope or fear’, rather than by physical restraint.³⁰ When we recognize that something promotes our self-preservation, we have (according to Hobbes’s account of motivation) a predominant desire for it, and in that respect our recognition of the effects of the action takes away our liberty not to perform the action and ‘binds’ us to perform the action. We act freely in choosing the action, in the sense of ‘free’ that Hobbes applies to actions, because our desires cause our action; but since our desires necessitate our action, they take away (in one respect) our liberty not to act.
- Hobbes does not think that the agreement creates the obligation, so that I am obliged to keep my promise in virtue of having made the promise to you and your having accepted it.
- He believes that we are obliged only when our acts of agreement are made in circumstances that offer us sufficient benefits and assure us of mutual compliance. When these conditions hold, we have a predominant desire to keep the agreement; this predominant desire is the motive that is the obligation.
- The agreement does not create the obligation; words or other signs are means, but not the source, of obligation. The words contribute to our being obliged only insofar as we have sufficient motives for doing what we say we will do.
- Observance of Laws of Nature (in foro interno or externo, as appropriate to the situation) promotes our interest and os, in this sense, they also oblige us by creating overriding motive. This obligation removes our freedom to violate them once we realize what they say. They oblige us only if we recognize that they are counsels of self-preservation. If we do not know this about the laws of nature, their mere existence does not restrict our freedom. Only ignorance of the content and implications of the laws of nature can explain their violation.
- The laws of nature and the virtues connected with them are eternal; they oblige, and are laws, in the court of conscience. The fulfliment of the natural law is ‘all we are obliged to by rational nature’ (Civ. 3.30). This is why the sovereign is subject to the laws of nature, though not to the civil law.
- According to Hobbes’s moral psychology, all predominant motives necessitate; hence we are obliged insofar as we have a predominant motive necessitating our action. In this sense the laws of nature oblige us.
- Non-physical obligation is different since it does not require any specific act of agreement between two parties. It is not so clear, however, whether it violates the principle that all obligation arises from one’s voluntary action. The laws of nature do not oblige any agents who do not seek to preserve themselves and to secure the way of their future desire; for they do not tell us to preserve ourselves, but only what we need to do if we want to preserve ourselves. Perhaps, then, the voluntary action that is presupposed is our self-preserving endeavour; this is not an act of agreement or consent that underlies the obligation (as in covenants), but it is still a voluntary action. 
- Hobbes holds a unified conception of non-physical obligation as the removal of liberty through voluntary action that results in a predominant motive. Within this conception, he can explain why the laws of nature prescribe and create obligations, by being empirical propositions about means to self-preservation.
- Hobbes agrees with some of Suarez’s claims about intrinsic morality: The laws of nature are precepts of reason in their own right, apart from divine commands, and so we ought to observe them. Hobbes takes a more naturalistic position than Suarez accepts, since he agrees with Vasquez’s view that the laws of nature create obligations apart from divine commands; this view follows from Hobbes’s motivational account of obligation together with his account of human motivation. Hobbes finds obligation without legislation (whereas Suarez not). Hobbes’s claim that the laws of nature oblige (L. 15.3, 36; Civ. 3.26, 27, 29) precedes his claims (in Civ. 4) about their divine origin and the obligation resulting from it. The obligation to keep the laws of nature does not require them to be laws commanded by God.
- God obliges us because he can punish us.
- Since obligation is imposition of necessity, and since the relevant type of necessity is psychological necessity, we are obliged wherever we have compelling motives, whether or not they result from commands. This is why the laws of nature oblige us, whether or not they are genuine laws. Whether or not God exists or commands them, they are counsels of self-preservation, but they are laws insofar as they are commanded by God
- Our obligation consists in our overriding desire to obey natural laws as means to selfpreservation, both because of their intrinsic character (apart from divine commands) and because we fear punishment, since God, even more than the sovereign, can enforce his will by force. A commander is necessary to turn the laws of nature into genuine laws, and their status as genuine laws provides us with a further source of obligation. It does not, however, provide us with a different kind of obligation; in both cases our obligation consists in the prospective benefits of following the laws of nature and the consequent desire to follow them.
- God is not bound to command one thing rather than another, but simply exercises power in commanding what God wills. So, we have no reason to infer that God commands an action only if that action seems to us to promote self-preservation; the character of the natural law shows nothing about necessary features of God’s will. In this respect, then, Hobbes is a voluntarist about the divine will and the content of morality. He implies that it is logically possible for God to command us to violate the counsels of self-preservation that we have overriding reason to pursue (apart from any beliefs about divine commands). On this point, he agrees with Ockham’s views about divine power and morality. 
- Hobbes does not allow any irreducible normative necessity; the necessity imposed by obligation is psychological. In Suarez’s view, God’s communicating a command to me is sufficient to oblige me to obey it, whether or not I want to obey it. According to Hobbes, however, it is not sufficient; my motivation is also necessary. Natural law is prescribed by correct reason only insofar as we have an overriding motive to obey it; and we have such a motive only towards counsels of self-preservation.
- God has a right to command this observance; and if we apply Hobbes’s account of a right to this claim about God’s right, we must take Hobbes to mean that God is free, since nothing prevents him, to command obedience and to enforce compliance with his command.
- Virtues are not needed by themselveds. We cannot find a reason if we simply consider human nature as shaped by the virtues; we must also consider it in the specific circumstances where we find a predominant desire to practise the virtues.
- Hobbes sees that the traditional virtues do not always promote self-preservation. He does not conclude that he is wrong to defend them by appeal to self-preservation, or that the laws of nature are not counsels of self-preservation; instead he concludes that we have no reason to practise the traditional virtues when they do not promote self-preservation.
- he does not give a deontological ground for our obligation to obey divine commands. Nor does he assess moral rules deontologically. He assesses them with reference to the public interest, and this assessment depends on a rule-utilitarian explanation.
- While it is helpful and appropriate to say that he tries to ‘vindicate’ and to ‘justify’ morality, and to show that we have ‘reason’ to follow it, it is also misleading; Hobbes has no room for these normative claims, except insofar as they can be reduced to claims about motivation. A justification of morality and a demonstration that we have reason to follow morality is simply a true prediction that in the specified circumstances we will have an overriding motive to follow it.
- He connects morality with self-preservation because he takes the desire for self-preservation to be our overriding motive; hence, his argument for reducing morality to self-preservation depends on his reduction of the normative to the psychological. If we reject the latter reduction, we have good reason to question his defence of morality. 
- Hobbes is not the first philosopher to appeal to a state of nature as a starting-point for understanding the basis of moral principles and political obligation. The 16th-century Scholastics and 17th-century natural law theorists also rely on a state of nature. 
- Why is the state of nature a condition of perpetual conflict? Hobbes’s most general argument rests on one aspect of his views about the subjectivity of goodness.⁶⁰ Since I use ‘good’ for what pleases me (oysters), and you use ‘good’ for what pleases you (cheese), we differ in our judgments about what things are good. Hence our judgments about goodness display ‘discord and strife’. Hobbes argues that this discord in judgments explains the discord that marks the state of nature. 
- Hobbes deals with the objection that helpung others is not advantageous in three stages: (1) It is sometimes correct. The state of nature sums up the circumstances in which we have no reason to practise the moral virtues. (2) However, we are worse off in these circumstances than if we are members of a commonwealth. Hence we ought to become members of a commonwealth and to follow the rules for the construction and the preservation of a commonwealth. The relevant rules are counsels for the preservation of peace, which are embodied in the moral virtues. (3) If we are members of a commonwealth, our self-preservation requires us to do whatever preserves peace, and hence requires us to practise the moral virtues
- Our desiders for competition may be either:
    - Part of our nature
    - Contingent in so far as there are not anough resources.
- If our desires are only contingently competitive, it may be more difficult for Hobbes to prove that the state of nature is so insecure that we need to create a commonwealth with unrestricted power to coerce. He may remove this difficulty if he is allowed to assume essentially competitive desires as part of human nature. But that assumption may make it more diffciult to explain the stability of a commonwealth of Hobbesian agents. A commonwealth may remove some confilcts, by assuring each of us of protection for our unshareable resources; but it does not prevent confilcts that arise from essentially competitive desires.
- When you asks 'Why should I pay my debts in the peace state? If I will cheat it will not destroy peace' you are in Hobbes' hands. You can't be sure that all other people do not think same as you do. So, it is why you need to do right actions








#                  Difficulties

- He claims that deliberation results from the foresight of good or evil consequences, and better deliberation results from the foresight of more consequences.²⁴ He assumes that if we foresee more of the consequences, we take account of their goodness and badness in our deliberation and in any decision that is based on deliberation. But Even if we confine goods to pleasures, we have no reason to assume that in the H-deliberating agent the apparently larger sum of future pleasures always arouses the stronger appetite. We may, for instance, be irrationally indifferent to the remoter future, or irrationally obsessed by it at the expense of shorter-term beneftis, and these irrational tendencies may determine the course of H-deliberation. So, consideration of more consequences may not improve my deliberation
- His remarks about better and worse deliberation rely on a normative conception of deliberation, taking it to consider what is best overall and what we ought to do in the light of what seems best overall. H-deliberation has no room for this normative conception.
- Hobbes can't use Socrates' position from Protagoras, where Socrates claims that we always act to an apparent larger sum future pleasures, because it implies that there is no incontinence, but Hobbes itself claims that there is incontinence.
- He may support his claims about deliberation and overall good by the empirical assumption that we always pursue the greater apparent good; but this empirical assumption conflicts with the possibility of incontinence. 
- Hobbes argues for anti-rationalism (the will is determined by the strongest passion) against Aquinas’ conception of freewill on 2 arguments: 
    - Deliberation (as Hobbes, conceives it) is found in animals, and so belongs both to rational and to non-rational agency
    - Even in human beings deliberation is not necessary for voluntary action, since impulsive and rash actions are also voluntary. This one is easy to reject: for, Aquinas may said that we treat it as voluntary because we assume it is subject to deliberation on some occasions, even if not immediately before acting. Aquinas’ distinction between directly and indirectly voluntary actions helps to show that unpremeditated action is voluntary if is suitably connected to deliberation, even if deliberation has not immediately preceded.
- If the good is what pleases me, then means same as what pleases me pleases me.
- Exposure to reason always results in self-preserving action. ‘Irrational’ action is chosen with less than full awareness of the consequences. These assumptions about motivation, however, revive the difficulty that arises from Hobbes’s views about incontinence. For reason speaks in favour of peace only if our strongest desire is for self-preservation and the means to it. But if we desire something else more strongly than we desire the means to self-preservation, reason should tell us to do what satisfeis this other desire. Since Hobbes recognizes that we sometimes have other desires stronger than the desire for self-preservation, he should also agree that reason does not always declare that peace is good. His own views cast doubt on the empirical assumptions that support his claims about practical reason.
- His eliminative treatment of will and passion implies that he can endorse prudence as rational only because he makes an implausible assumption — implausible even within his own account of the passions — about motivation. His position would be more consistent if he were to deny that prudence itself is rational, and to argue that it is rational to follow the prudent course of action only if we have the relevant desire. He ought to agree that when our desires are relevantly different, prudence is not rational, since we will not adopt the prudent course of action when we are informed about the consequences of the choices open to us. Hobbes does not draw this conclusion from his account of practical reason.
- Hobbes does not distinguish process from activity, as Aristotle understands them.⁵⁷ Hobbes assumes that action, as opposed to passive enjoyment, is instrumental, aimed at the achieving of some end separate from it. Aristotle rejects this assumption, since he recognizes activities that are parts of happiness and to be chosen for their own sakes. If we achieve the ultimate end, we still have a motive for action; for we want to perform the activities that are characteristic of being happy. Aristotle’s conception seems ridiculous from Hobbes’s point of view only because Hobbes cannot see the point of Aristotle’s distinction between process and activity. He cannot see the point of it because it conflicts with Hobbes’s view that action is all purely instrumental.
- From an Aristotelian point of view, therefore, Hobbes is one of the people who argue too hastily from variation in evaluative judgments to metaphysical subjectivism (EN 1094b14–19). He does not show that observed variations in judgment require the subjectivist explanation. As Aristotle points out, if sick people value health more than habitually healthy people value it, that disagreement is easily explained by their different perspectives. Again, if some people prefer lobster and others prefer cheese, and we cannot show that one is really better than the other, that may be because they are equally good.
- For if I oblige myself by covenant to repay my debt to you, I do not abridge or ‘lay aside’ my physical freedom to refrain from paying my debt; on the contrary, if I did not keep that physical freedom, there would be no need for me to make a covenant.  For if I oblige myself by covenant to repay my debt to you, I do not abridge or ‘lay aside’ my physical freedom to refrain from paying my debt; on the contrary, if I did not keep that physical freedom, there would be no need for me to make a covenant.
- Moreover, if Hobbes’s claims about liberties and rights must be taken to refer to moral rather than physical liberty, he has not vindicated his claims about the right of nature. For the mere fact that nothing stops me from trying to preserve myself does not show that I am morally free to do whatever I think will preserve me. If Hobbes argues for the right of nature from the mere fact of physical freedom, he is wrong to say that the obligation incurred in making a promise is the laying aside of a right. If his position is consistent, his claim about the right of nature should assert my moral freedom in the state of nature. But then he needs some defence of the claim; the mere fact of physical freedom is not a sufficient defence.
- Sometimes Hobbes suggests that a voluntary act is necessary for all non-physical obligation (where physical obligation = something like being bounded). But how, we might ask, could this be true of the obligation arising from the laws of nature? And what does the obligation consist in? We have found that it is unhelpful to say simply that it is the renunciation of moral liberty, and then to say that moral liberty is simply the absence of obligation. 
- Although Hobbes agrees with Vasquez'es view that Natural Law exist without Divine Legislation, Hobbes sometimes agrees with Suarez’s account of a law, taking it to require the command of a legislator. Sometimes he says that Laws of Nature, without legislative will of God, would only advices about self-preservation, and would not carry the obligation that belongs to a law. What does Hobbes take to be added by a divine command? Suarez believes that a command is needed to create genuine law, and to create obligation, since obligation requires the imposition of necessity through a command. Hobbes agrees with him on the first point, since he claims that the laws of nature are not properly laws unless they are commands. But he does not seem to agree that commands are necessary for obligation. God’s commands take away freedom through hope of rewards and fear of punishments; this hope and fear is the source of the obligation. Once we recognize that there is a God and that he is the creator, and that he rewards and punishes for obedience and disobedience to the natural law, we are obliged to obey the natural law.⁴³ God’s commands are relevant because God supports them with sanctions. The command itself does not create the obligation, but the obligation consists in the motives that are excited by the sanctions.
- When Hobbes suggests that the subjectivity of goodness results in discord, he seems to confuse variation of taste, disagreement in judgment, and conflict in action. Perhaps he fails to distinguish (1) the ‘discord’ that consists in failure to agree in objective judgments about which things are good, from (2) the discord that consists in conflicting plans and actions.
The first sort of discord is not the source of the most serious conflicts in the state of nature.
