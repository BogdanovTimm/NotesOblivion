- There is no supreme good of the sort that the old moral philosophers accepted. 
- The principle of self-love is not supreme, but is subordinate to conscience 
- Scotus formulates the anti-intellectualist objections clearly, and presents a voluntarist account of the will
- He argues for both voluntarism and rationalism. On the one hand, he denies that the will is determined by intellect. On the other hand, he maintains a sharp division between the rational will and the non-rational passions. He maintains voluntarism to defend freedom, but maintains rationalism to maintain the primacy of reason over passion in determining virtuous action. 
- To show that his voluntarism is consistent with his rationalism, Scotus needs to show that the will is rational even though it is not determined, as the intellectualist supposes, by reason.
