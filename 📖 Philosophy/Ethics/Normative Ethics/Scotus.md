- Naturalism is false
- Rationalism (virtue = to be guided by praxtical reason) is true
- Non-eudamonism moralism is true: happiness is not needed for a sufficient justification of virtue.
- Christianuty conflicts with Greek ethics
- An indeterminist doctrine of responsibility fits the doctrine of Christian predestination
- Christian doctrine to require the decisive rejection of an Aristotelian framework
- Scotus quotes Augustine at crucial places to defend departures from Aquinas’ Aristotelian position
- Virtues are in the will as opposed to the passions
- Rejects Reciprocity of virtues
- There is no supreme good of the sort that the old moral philosophers accepted. 
- The principle of self-love is not supreme, but is subordinate to conscience 
- Scotus formulates the anti-intellectualist objections clearly, and presents a voluntarist account of the will
- He argues for both voluntarism and rationalism. On the one hand, he denies that the will is determined by intellect. On the other hand, he maintains a sharp division between the rational will and the non-rational passions. He maintains voluntarism to defend freedom, but maintains rationalism to maintain the primacy of reason over passion in determining virtuous action. 
- To show that his voluntarism is consistent with his rationalism, Scotus needs to show that the will is rational even though it is not determined, as the intellectualist supposes, by reason. 
- Some critics believe it is misleading or unhelpful to describe Scotus as a voluntarist, or even to be preoccupied with the question of whether he is a voluntarist: ‘Thanks to the serious research advanced by notable scholars, this question no longer preoccupies us
- Scotus argues that the will is neither essentially nor necessarily rational. He maintains that unless we agree that the will does not necessarily follow intellect, we deny freewill. 
- He has three main arguments against eudaemonism: 
    - Psychological: facts of experience show that we sometimes fail to pursue what we believe to promote our happiness:
        - Because we can suspend our action
        - Because we don't think about happiness all the time: we can pursue particular end, without thinking about happiness. Or we may see that X not promotes happiness, while !X does and still we choose X. 
    - Moral: the eudaemonist position conflicts with facts about the moral virtues and the motives of the virtuous person.
    - Metaphysical (libertarian): the eudaemonist position implies that the will is not free, because we are not free to reject happiness, or to choose contrary to what we believe to promote it.
Though these arguments raise distinct issues, they are difficult to keep apart; in particular, Scotus’ views about rationality and freedom influence his objections to eudaemonism on psychological and moral grounds.
- Pursue of one's own advantage is not a mark of a good action. The only good mark of the good action is a pursuiing of the justice. Also, he thinks that happiness consists only one of one's advantage. So, pursue of happiness is not a mark of a good action  
- We can seek something besides our advantage because we will see that the thing besides our advantage is a more reasonable to pursue 
- Justice can be understood either as:
    - infused (which is called ‘‘gratuitous’’)
    - acquired (which is called ‘‘moral’’)
    - innate (which is the very freedom of the will)’ (2Sent. d6 q2 = OO vi 1, 539 §8 = W 468). Scotus identifies the affection for justice with ‘the innate freedom of the will, in accordance with which it is capable of willing some good not directed towards itself
- We have a natural tendency to pursue our own happiness (identified with our self-confined advantage); freedom not to follow this natural tendency is a necessary condition of having the affection for justice. 
- free will is not bound in every way to will happiness, in the way in which it would will it if it were only an intellectual desire without freedom 
- There is a standard that shows us how far it is reasonable to pursue our own advantage and how far it is reasonable to pursue the other end. This standard estimates different ends by reference to some impartial conception of what deserves to be chosen. Attachment to this impartial standard is the affection for justice. Hence the affection for justice is not a natural affection that we freely chose to follow; it is the expression of freedom. 
- Since the choice of happiness is sometimes blameworthy, it must be the free choice of evil; since the will is free to refuse it, the will cannot be determined to pursue happiness. 
- Scotus’ attack on eudaemonism shows that he does not take the supremacy of self-interest for granted, and that he does not treat this as the only principle of practical reason. On this point, he rejects the main tradition of ancient and mediaeval ethics. His only predecessors are the Cyrenaics
- the will in a human being is called a rational capacity because it is capable of opposites 
- Scotus argues that a will with the strong capacity for opposites (i.e., the capacity to actualize either one without external determination) is needed if our action is to be contingent 
- Scotus maintains, against Aquinas’ intellectualism, that the belief that x is better than y does not determine the will to choose x rather than y. If anything external to the will determined the will, it would exclude freewill; for it would imply that the will itself is not a capacity for opposites, since something external to it would determine which opposite would be realized.
This argument helps us to see how Scotus’ position goes beyond the simple rejection of intellectualism. If I freely choose between x and y, my choice (according to the anti-intellectualist) is not determined by my conception of the merits of x and y, since that would be determination by an appearance that lies outside the will; but my choice may still be determined by how the will is. If we attribute this sort of freedom to the will, we might still accept a determinist (or compatibilist) account of the formation of the will. Voluntarism, therefore, does not include incompatibilism, and so does not require indeterminism. 
- His strong claim about the will as a rational capacity commits him to both voluntarism and indeterminism. 
- He rejects not only passions but also intellect as the subject of the moral virtues. Also, he believes that if we place virtue in the intellect, we make vice a matter of ignorance, so that virtue and vice will not be open to praise and blame. He argues, therefore, against the view that virtue consists in correct reason.⁴ If this view were right, the will would be passive in relation to the intellect; hence (Scotus infers) we would not be blameworthy, since our errors could be traced back to cognitive mistake or ignorance.⁵ If a mistaken choice of the will results from ignorance of the good, the will did not choose freely, and therefore we cannot be blamed for the choice. Since we are praised and blamed for virtue and vice, virtue and vice must belong fundamentally to a will that does not necessarily follow practical reason. If the will necessarily followed practical reason, it would not warrant praise or blame, and so would not be the subject of virtue and vice. 
- passion and ignorance are not sources of blameworthy error, and that only the will is fundamentally responsible. 
- Intellect grasps the first principles of morality, but they do not necessarily move the will, since the will is free and is not necessarily moved in one or the other direction by what intellect discovers 
- Scotus denies this link between prudence and motivation, whether prudence tells us about what is required for happiness or about what is required for justice. The information that it gives us must leave the will free to choose one way or another. 
- If Scotus is right, the virtuous and the vicious person may have the same conception of happiness. 
- Prudence is vertically unified because the prudence belonging to each virtue includes both universal and particular prudence; but it is horizontally divided among the different virtues and so he denies Reciprocity of the virtues 
- In agreement with Aquinas, he recognizes a natural law that we grasp by natural reason, and he believes that God prescribes the observance of this natural law. But he differs from Aquinas about the extent of the natural law, and about its relation to the will of God. He is less opti-mistic about the practical guidance we can derive from the higher principles of natural law.
According to Scotus, natural law is relevant to our moral knowledge in three ways:
(1) We know that some moral principle is true from its terms, so that it is a first principle corresponding to a first principle of demonstration in theoretical science. (2) A principle follows evidently from a first principle. (3) A principle is said to belong to natural law by extension if it is a practical truth concordant (consonum) with the principles or conclusions of natural law, ‘in so far as it is immediately known to all to agree (convenire) with such a law' 
- political life is not justified by the natural law. 
- Scotus, however, claims that the precepts of the second table of the Decalogue, containing duties towards our neighbour, belong to the third class of principles. Unlike principles in the second class, they do not follow evidently from the first principles. Though they ‘agree’ with the natural law, they are not required by it.²⁶ In opposition to the view of Aquinas that all the moral precepts of the Decalogue belong to the natural law, ²⁷ Scotus claims that the second table does not belong to it in the strictest sense. Its precepts are not necessary for achieving the end that is pursued in the natural law.
- he believes that the second table of the Decalogue goes beyond the natural law, strictly speaking, and that its precepts are dispensable. Contrary to Aquinas, Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice Isaac is not justified by the natural law, but is permissible only because of a dispensation; God decides that Abraham need not obey the moral principle that we are usually required to obey. Though Abraham’s intended action is murder, God does not require him to refrain from intending murder in this case. Since the specific prohibition on intending murder is not required by the natural law, but is a command of God, intending murder is wrong only because it violates a command of God. If, therefore, God commands us to commit a murder, he makes murder permissible in this case.³⁴ God is free to dispense from the general rules because they are the result of God’s choice. 
- he agrees with Anselm’s claim that only what God wills is just and what God does not will is not just. But, he interprets Anselm’s claim so that it fits voluntarism. He treats justice as the result of God’s choice, undetermined by any knowledge of what is best.
- According to Scotus, if God had chosen to treat human beings completely capriciously, without reference to their merits, their desert, or their nature, that treatment would have been just.
- Some of the difficulties that Scotus raises are clearer if we distinguish different things that might or might not be subject to the will of God. Three claims deserve to be considered:
    - Avoiding murder and theft is usually, though not always, good for creatures with our nature. Scotus does not take God to have power over the first claim. He does not suggest that God’s free choice determines what is good for creatures with our nature
    - Avoiding murder and theft is usually, though not always, in accordance with natural law.
    - It is usually, though not always, right, to follow the natural law. 
Different types of voluntarism result from giving God power over the truth or falsity of these three claims 
- Scotus argues that God’s freedom in relation to precepts of justice does not make God arbitrary or capricious; God’s goodwill is reliable even though it is not necessary. God’s generosity explains how God reliably benefits us even though God is free not to benefit us.
When God created us, God freely undertook to follow natural law, which seems to express the same impartial norms as those that appeal to our affection for justice. 
- we do not necessarily will happiness 
- Freedom is supposed to provide appropriate grounds for praise and blame; hence Scotus complains that an intellectualist account makes sin non-blameworthy by reducing it to cognitive error. 
- He argues for both voluntarism and rationalism 
- As we have understood Scotus, he holds an externalist view about the relation between the grasp of moral principles and motivation. 
- As we have understood Scotus, he holds an externalist view about the relation between the grasp of moral principles and motivation. This raises a difficulty for his claim that prudence makes an action morally good. 
- Ockham agrees that prudence accords with correct reason, so that prudence is a partial efficient cause of the virtuous action. It is not the whole efficient cause, however, because virtue requires an independent act of willing in accordance with the dictates of correct reason. 














# Difficulties

- Scotus argues not that some desires are independent of the desire for happiness, but that the will is independent of it. Will differs from passion in being rational desire, and hence in being responsive to critical evaluation of one’s desires and their objects. Aquinas claims that will is thoroughly rational desire because it responds to the global criticism that our conception of happiness applies to particular objects of desire. This conception of will underlies Cajetan’s objection to Scotus. Scotus does not explain why the agent who prefers a particular good over his conception of the ultimate good acts not on a passion, but on a rational desire that belongs to the will. Hence he does not refute eudaemonism.
Scotus describes the will as ‘free desire’ (liber appetitus), and so denies that it is determined by the antecedent strength of one’s non-rational desire—in this case the desire for happiness.
Aquinas agrees that the will is free by not being determined by the strength of non-rational desires; he takes this freedom to require the will to respond to the rational evaluation of desires. But the choices that we recognize, according to Scotus, as contrary to our conception of our ultimate end seem to be determined by the antecedent strength of our particular desires. If the ‘free desire’ identified with the will does not rest on evaluation of our desires, how does it differ from a passion? Scotus’ argument to show that we can desire objects contrary to happiness does not show that we can will them. 
- Scotus thinks that potential to do other-regarding things makes us free agents. But it follows that being bad = being not free
- Freedom seems to require the ability to reject justice no less than the ability to reject happiness. 
- Scotus could maintain a consistently voluntarist position by abandoning his claim that freedom of the will consists in the affection for justice. But then he would also abandon his reason for believing that a free will is also a rational will. On the one hand, he contrasts the free will with dependence on natural inclination, but on the other hand, he contrasts it with dependence on the greater good. The first contrast gives us a reason to reject the second;
for the relevant contrast between the rational will and non-rational inclination requires the will to be responsive to value in a way that is excluded by the second contrast. 
- if we deny the identification of freedom with the affection for justice, we make it more difficult to separate the will from the passions. If the impartial attitude of the affection for the just is the outlook of reason, the free and rational will acts primarily through the affection for the just. But if the will is equally expressed through the rejection of happiness for something worse, through the affection for advantage, and through the affection for the just, what makes the will a rational capacity? It is not easy to defend Scotus’ belief that the will is rational without his claim that the affection for the just most fully expresses the free will. 
- If the will is a rational capacity, and the two affections of the will are two aspects of the application of practical reason to our actions, perhaps they express the same general principle. In deliberating with a view to our own happiness, we impose the appropriate rational order on our desires with reference to our own good; in deliberating with a view to justice, we impose the appropriate rational order on the desires of the different people affected. Deliberation with reference to happiness imperfectly embodies practical reason for only one person’s desires, whereas deliberation with reference to justice embodies it more fully.
This interpretation of Scotus fits the intellectualist version of his doctrine of freedom. But it does not account for all of his position. The most plausible argument for the supremacy of justice treats the affection for justice as a higher level of the sort of rational order that is present in the desire for happiness. If we find this rational order in the desire for happiness, it is plausible to treat the desire for happiness as a necessary structural feature of a rational agent
- Butler, Reid, and Sidgwick say that the rational pursuit of happiness gives us the reason that impartial justice is even more rational that pursuit of happiness. In trying to maintain the rationality of the affection for justice without allowing the rationality of the desire for happiness, Kant weakens his case for the supremacy of justice. 
- If I freely choose between x and y, my choice (according to the anti-intellectualist) is not determined by my conception of the merits of x and y, since that would be determination by an appearance that lies outside the will; but my choice may still be determined by how the will is. If we attribute this sort of freedom to the will, we might still accept a determinist (or compatibilist) account of the formation of the will. Voluntarism, therefore, does not include incompatibilism, and so does not require indeterminism.
But this version of voluntarism may well seem unattractive. It is difficult to see why appearances and considerations should be the only external determinants that exclude free will. Compatibilist voluntarism, however, allows our beliefs, values, and choices, to be determined by a sequence of sufficient conditions that goes back outside us, indeed to events long before we were born.
- Scotus, therefore, concedes something to those who take the secondary principles to be independent of God’s legislative will. For the fact that truthfulness is more consonant with the primary principles of natural law is not a result of God’s legislation. The primary principles are not fixed by God’s free choice, and their content, rather than God’s choice, determines what is more or less consonant with them. Scotus sees a role for God’s choice, however, in the fact that these rules should not always be observed. They are highly consonant, but not required, because sometimes we ought not to follow them. In claiming that some rules derived from the common principles of natural law should not always be observed, Scotus agrees with Aquinas (ST 1-2 q94 a4).⁴⁶ He infers that on the occasions when we ought not to observe the highly consonant rules, God freely dispenses us from their observance. Hence, in his view, the secondary principles are not required by natural law, but are fixed by God’s choice.
But this is a puzzling conclusion. Scotus seems to argue that if a given secondary principle is not required by natural law, it depends on God’s free choice and God can dispense us from observing it. But how can it be up to God to choose the secondary principles, if some courses of action are especially consonant with nature and the higher principles? Scotus concedes that even though the correct secondary principles do not follow necessarily from the higher principles, rational inquiry can discover their special consonance with the higher principles.
In that case God should have practical knowledge of the secondary principles, contrary to Scotus’ view. Since practical reason can establish them, God could not reject them without willing injustice. 
- Perhaps the conflicting tendencies in Scotus’ claims about secondary principles can be explained by an ambiguity in his claim that observance of these principles is not necessary for achieving the final good. This claim might mean two things: (1) We can achieve the final good even if we violate these rules in every case. (2) We can achieve the final good even if we violate them in some cases. The second claim, but not the first, allows us to believe that the rules are highly consonant with natural law. The first claim, but not the second, allows us to believe that God exercises free choice in prescribing the observance of these rules and in dispensing us from it.
Since some of Scotus’ claims seem to depend on the first interpretation of his claim about non-necessity and some seem to depend on the second, and since the two interpretations are incompatible, his position seems to be unstable. The claims about consonance moderate his voluntarism. But if they conflict with the voluntarist claims he accepts, they suggest that his version of voluntarism is difficult to maintain. 
- His claims about freedom, the will, and the affection for justice express both a more intellectualist tendency (identifying freedom with the rational affection for justice) and a more voluntarist tendency (identifying freedom with the undetermined capacity to choose either advantage or justice). Similarly, he treats God as partly sovereign over the natural law, but denies that God alters the natural law randomly or arbitrarily; hence he claims that the precepts of the second table of the Decalogue are ‘highly consonant’ with the natural law, though not required by it.
