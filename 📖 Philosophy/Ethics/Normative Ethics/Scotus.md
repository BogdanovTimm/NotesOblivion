- Naturalism is false
- Rationalism (virtue = to be guided by praxtical reason) is true
- Non-eudamonism moralism is true: happiness is not needed for a sufficient justification of virtue.
- Christianuty conflicts with Greek ethics
- An indeterminist doctrine of responsibility fits the doctrine of Christian predestination
- Christian doctrine to require the decisive rejection of an Aristotelian framework
- Scotus quotes Augustine at crucial places to defend departures from Aquinas’ Aristotelian position
- Virtues are in the will as opposed to the passions
- Rejects Reciprocity of virtues
- There is no supreme good of the sort that the old moral philosophers accepted. 
- The principle of self-love is not supreme, but is subordinate to conscience 
- Scotus formulates the anti-intellectualist objections clearly, and presents a voluntarist account of the will
- He argues for both voluntarism and rationalism. On the one hand, he denies that the will is determined by intellect. On the other hand, he maintains a sharp division between the rational will and the non-rational passions. He maintains voluntarism to defend freedom, but maintains rationalism to maintain the primacy of reason over passion in determining virtuous action. 
- To show that his voluntarism is consistent with his rationalism, Scotus needs to show that the will is rational even though it is not determined, as the intellectualist supposes, by reason. 
- Some critics believe it is misleading or unhelpful to describe Scotus as a voluntarist, or even to be preoccupied with the question of whether he is a voluntarist: ‘Thanks to the serious research advanced by notable scholars, this question no longer preoccupies us
- Scotus argues that the will is neither essentially nor necessarily rational. He maintains that unless we agree that the will does not necessarily follow intellect, we deny freewill. 
- He has three main arguments against eudaemonism: 
    - Psychological: facts of experience show that we sometimes fail to pursue what we believe to promote our happiness.
    - Moral: the eudaemonist position conflicts with facts about the moral virtues and the motives of the virtuous person.
    - Metaphysical (libertarian): the eudaemonist position implies that the will is not free, because we are not free to reject happiness, or to choose contrary to what we believe to promote it.
Though these arguments raise distinct issues, they are difficult to keep apart; in particular, Scotus’ views about rationality and freedom influence his objections to eudaemonism on psychological and moral grounds.
