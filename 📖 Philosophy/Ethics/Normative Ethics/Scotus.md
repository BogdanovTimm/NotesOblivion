- Naturalism is false
- Rationalism (virtue = to be guided by praxtical reason) is true
- Non-eudamonism moralism is true: happiness is not needed for a sufficient justification of virtue.
- Christianuty conflicts with Greek ethics
- An indeterminist doctrine of responsibility fits the doctrine of Christian predestination
- Christian doctrine to require the decisive rejection of an Aristotelian framework
- Scotus quotes Augustine at crucial places to defend departures from Aquinas’ Aristotelian position
- Virtues are in the will as opposed to the passions
- Rejects Reciprocity of virtues
- There is no supreme good of the sort that the old moral philosophers accepted. 
- The principle of self-love is not supreme, but is subordinate to conscience 
- Scotus formulates the anti-intellectualist objections clearly, and presents a voluntarist account of the will
- He argues for both voluntarism and rationalism. On the one hand, he denies that the will is determined by intellect. On the other hand, he maintains a sharp division between the rational will and the non-rational passions. He maintains voluntarism to defend freedom, but maintains rationalism to maintain the primacy of reason over passion in determining virtuous action. 
- To show that his voluntarism is consistent with his rationalism, Scotus needs to show that the will is rational even though it is not determined, as the intellectualist supposes, by reason. 
- Some critics believe it is misleading or unhelpful to describe Scotus as a voluntarist, or even to be preoccupied with the question of whether he is a voluntarist: ‘Thanks to the serious research advanced by notable scholars, this question no longer preoccupies us
- Scotus argues that the will is neither essentially nor necessarily rational. He maintains that unless we agree that the will does not necessarily follow intellect, we deny freewill. 
- He has three main arguments against eudaemonism: 
    - Psychological: facts of experience show that we sometimes fail to pursue what we believe to promote our happiness:
        - Because we can suspend our action
        - Because we don't think about happiness all the time: we can pursue particular end, without thinking about happiness. Or we may see that X not promotes happiness, while !X does and still we choose X. 
    - Moral: the eudaemonist position conflicts with facts about the moral virtues and the motives of the virtuous person.
    - Metaphysical (libertarian): the eudaemonist position implies that the will is not free, because we are not free to reject happiness, or to choose contrary to what we believe to promote it.
Though these arguments raise distinct issues, they are difficult to keep apart; in particular, Scotus’ views about rationality and freedom influence his objections to eudaemonism on psychological and moral grounds.
- Pursue of one's own advantage is not a mark of a good action. The only good mark of the good action is a pursuiing of the justice. Also, he thinks that happiness consists only one of one's advantage. So, pursue of happiness is not a mark of a good action  
- We can seek something besides our advantage because we will see that the thing besides our advantage is a more reasonable to pursue 
- Justice can be understood either as:
    - infused (which is called ‘‘gratuitous’’)
    - acquired (which is called ‘‘moral’’)
    - innate (which is the very freedom of the will)’ (2Sent. d6 q2 = OO vi 1, 539 §8 = W 468). Scotus identifies the affection for justice with ‘the innate freedom of the will, in accordance with which it is capable of willing some good not directed towards itself
- We have a natural tendency to pursue our own happiness (identified with our self-confined advantage); freedom not to follow this natural tendency is a necessary condition of having the affection for justice. 
- free will is not bound in every way to will happiness, in the way in which it would will it if it were only an intellectual desire without freedom 
- There is a standard that shows us how far it is reasonable to pursue our own advantage and how far it is reasonable to pursue the other end. This standard estimates different ends by reference to some impartial conception of what deserves to be chosen. Attachment to this impartial standard is the affection for justice. Hence the affection for justice is not a natural affection that we freely chose to follow; it is the expression of freedom. 
- Since the choice of happiness is sometimes blameworthy, it must be the free choice of evil; since the will is free to refuse it, the will cannot be determined to pursue happiness. 
- Scotus’ attack on eudaemonism shows that he does not take the supremacy of self-interest for granted, and that he does not treat this as the only principle of practical reason. On this point, he rejects the main tradition of ancient and mediaeval ethics. His only predecessors are the Cyrenaics

# Difficulties

- Scotus argues not that some desires are independent of the desire for happiness, but that the will is independent of it. Will differs from passion in being rational desire, and hence in being responsive to critical evaluation of one’s desires and their objects. Aquinas claims that will is thoroughly rational desire because it responds to the global criticism that our conception of happiness applies to particular objects of desire. This conception of will underlies Cajetan’s objection to Scotus. Scotus does not explain why the agent who prefers a particular good over his conception of the ultimate good acts not on a passion, but on a rational desire that belongs to the will. Hence he does not refute eudaemonism.
Scotus describes the will as ‘free desire’ (liber appetitus), and so denies that it is determined by the antecedent strength of one’s non-rational desire—in this case the desire for happiness.
Aquinas agrees that the will is free by not being determined by the strength of non-rational desires; he takes this freedom to require the will to respond to the rational evaluation of desires. But the choices that we recognize, according to Scotus, as contrary to our conception of our ultimate end seem to be determined by the antecedent strength of our particular desires. If the ‘free desire’ identified with the will does not rest on evaluation of our desires, how does it differ from a passion? Scotus’ argument to show that we can desire objects contrary to happiness does not show that we can will them. 
- Scotus thinks that potential to do other-regarding things makes us free agents. But it follows that being bad = being not free
- Freedom seems to require the ability to reject justice no less than the ability to reject happiness. 
- Scotus could maintain a consistently voluntarist position by abandoning his claim that freedom of the will consists in the affection for justice. But then he would also abandon his reason for believing that a free will is also a rational will. On the one hand, he contrasts the free will with dependence on natural inclination, but on the other hand, he contrasts it with dependence on the greater good. The first contrast gives us a reason to reject the second;
for the relevant contrast between the rational will and non-rational inclination requires the will to be responsive to value in a way that is excluded by the second contrast. 
- if we deny the identification of freedom with the affection for justice, we make it more difficult to separate the will from the passions. If the impartial attitude of the affection for the just is the outlook of reason, the free and rational will acts primarily through the affection for the just. But if the will is equally expressed through the rejection of happiness for something worse, through the affection for advantage, and through the affection for the just, what makes the will a rational capacity? It is not easy to defend Scotus’ belief that the will is rational without his claim that the affection for the just most fully expresses the free will. 
- If the will is a rational capacity, and the two affections of the will are two aspects of the application of practical reason to our actions, perhaps they express the same general principle. In deliberating with a view to our own happiness, we impose the appropriate rational order on our desires with reference to our own good; in deliberating with a view to justice, we impose the appropriate rational order on the desires of the different people affected. Deliberation with reference to happiness imperfectly embodies practical reason for only one person’s desires, whereas deliberation with reference to justice embodies it more fully.
This interpretation of Scotus fits the intellectualist version of his doctrine of freedom. But it does not account for all of his position.
