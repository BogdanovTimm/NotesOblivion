- Naturalism is false
- Rationalism (virtue = to be guided by praxtical reason) is true
- Non-eudamonism moralism is true: happiness is not needed for a sufficient justification of virtue.
- Christianuty conflicts with Greek ethics
- An indeterminist doctrine of responsibility fits the doctrine of Christian predestination
- Christian doctrine to require the decisive rejection of an Aristotelian framework
- Scotus quotes Augustine at crucial places to defend departures from Aquinas’ Aristotelian position
- Virtues are in the will as opposed to the passions
- Rejects Reciprocity of virtues
- There is no supreme good of the sort that the old moral philosophers accepted. 
- The principle of self-love is not supreme, but is subordinate to conscience 
- Scotus formulates the anti-intellectualist objections clearly, and presents a voluntarist account of the will
- He argues for both voluntarism and rationalism. On the one hand, he denies that the will is determined by intellect. On the other hand, he maintains a sharp division between the rational will and the non-rational passions. He maintains voluntarism to defend freedom, but maintains rationalism to maintain the primacy of reason over passion in determining virtuous action. 
- To show that his voluntarism is consistent with his rationalism, Scotus needs to show that the will is rational even though it is not determined, as the intellectualist supposes, by reason. 
- Some critics believe it is misleading or unhelpful to describe Scotus as a voluntarist, or even to be preoccupied with the question of whether he is a voluntarist: ‘Thanks to the serious research advanced by notable scholars, this question no longer preoccupies us
- Scotus argues that the will is neither essentially nor necessarily rational. He maintains that unless we agree that the will does not necessarily follow intellect, we deny freewill. 
- He has three main arguments against eudaemonism: 
    - Psychological: facts of experience show that we sometimes fail to pursue what we believe to promote our happiness:
        - Because we can suspend our action
        - Because we don't think about happiness all the time: we can pursue particular end, without thinking about happiness. Or we may see that X not promotes happiness, while !X does and still we choose X. 
    - Moral: the eudaemonist position conflicts with facts about the moral virtues and the motives of the virtuous person.
    - Metaphysical (libertarian): the eudaemonist position implies that the will is not free, because we are not free to reject happiness, or to choose contrary to what we believe to promote it.
Though these arguments raise distinct issues, they are difficult to keep apart; in particular, Scotus’ views about rationality and freedom influence his objections to eudaemonism on psychological and moral grounds.
- Pursue of one's own advantage is not a mark of a good action. The only good mark of the good action is a pursuiing of the justice. Also, he thinks that happiness consists only one of one's advantage. So, pursue of happiness is not a mark of a good action  
- We can seek something besides our advantage because we will see that the thing besides our advantage is a more reasonable to pursue 
- Justice can be understood either as infused (which is called ‘‘gratuitous’’) or as acquired (which is called ‘‘moral’’) or as innate (which is the very freedom of the will)’ (2Sent. d6 q2 = OO vi 1, 539 §8 = W 468). Scotus identifies the affection for justice with ‘the innate freedom of the will, in accordance with which it is capable of willing some good not directed towards itself 

# Difficulties

- Scotus argues not that some desires are independent of the desire for happiness, but that the will is independent of it. Will differs from passion in being rational desire, and hence in being responsive to critical evaluation of one’s desires and their objects. Aquinas claims that will is thoroughly rational desire because it responds to the global criticism that our conception of happiness applies to particular objects of desire. This conception of will underlies Cajetan’s objection to Scotus. Scotus does not explain why the agent who prefers a particular good over his conception of the ultimate good acts not on a passion, but on a rational desire that belongs to the will. Hence he does not refute eudaemonism.
Scotus describes the will as ‘free desire’ (liber appetitus), and so denies that it is determined by the antecedent strength of one’s non-rational desire—in this case the desire for happiness.
Aquinas agrees that the will is free by not being determined by the strength of non-rational desires; he takes this freedom to require the will to respond to the rational evaluation of desires. But the choices that we recognize, according to Scotus, as contrary to our conception of our ultimate end seem to be determined by the antecedent strength of our particular desires. If the ‘free desire’ identified with the will does not rest on evaluation of our desires, how does it differ from a passion? Scotus’ argument to show that we can desire objects contrary to happiness does not show that we can will them.
