- Kant uses a counterfactual argument somewhat similar to Plato’s to argue that agents lack a good will and that their actions lack moral worth if they choose to do what duty requires for the sake of its good consequences. He concludes that we have a good will only if we choose ‘duty for duty’s sake’, so that we choose what is morally required precisely because it is morally required and not because of some further aspect of it that is not essential to its being morally required
- Rejects the supremacy of reasons based on one’s own good for being moral
- Non-eudamonism moralism is true: happiness is not needed for a sufficient justification of virtue.
- Against sentimrntalism, Kant argues that rational agents deserve respect from others, irrespective of anyone’s sympathies.
- We might even agree that virtue requires the choice of the right action for the right reason, looking to the very fact that makes the action right. This demand might be understood, as Kant understands it, non-teleologically, so that it does not refer to any connexion between virtuous action and one’s ultimate end.
- Apart from our moral beliefs, we have no reason to attribute freedom to human beings
