- Kant uses a counterfactual argument somewhat similar to Plato’s to argue that agents lack a good will and that their actions lack moral worth if they choose to do what duty requires for the sake of its good consequences. He concludes that we have a good will only if we choose ‘duty for duty’s sake’, so that we choose what is morally required precisely because it is morally required and not because of some further aspect of it that is not essential to its being morally required
- Rejects the supremacy of reasons based on one’s own good for being moral
- Non-eudamonism moralism is true: happiness is not needed for a sufficient justification of virtue.
- Against sentimrntalism, Kant argues that rational agents deserve respect from others, irrespective of anyone’s sympathies.
- We might even agree that virtue requires the choice of the right action for the right reason, looking to the very fact that makes the action right. This demand might be understood, as Kant understands it, non-teleologically, so that it does not refer to any connexion between virtuous action and one’s ultimate end.
- Apart from our moral beliefs, we have no reason to attribute freedom to human beings
- Kant’s contrast between acting on duty and acting on other motives: The two people he contrasts with the person acting out of duty are the trader who does the honest thing for the sake of his business and the philanthropist who acts out of his generous sentiments. The action of the philanthropist lacks moral worth not because it is selfish, but because his reason for doing the generous action rests ultimately on his generous impulses; if he lacked them, he would have lost his reason for these actions. Kant is primarily concerned with the distinction that Aquinas draws in his account of intellectual love.
- Pufendorf, then, seems to be open to the objections that Cudworth raises against Hobbes. Kant summarizes these objections in claiming that positive law presupposes natural law.⁴⁶ We might not agree with Kant’s claim that the ground of the authority of a legislator of positive law must be moral, and therefore must be part of natural law. But his claim is plausible if we consider a legislative theory of the natural moral law itself; the non-moral grounds that Pufendorf offers do not vindicate the authority of a moral legislator. Hence at least one natural law cannot itself be valid simply because it has been legislated by a divine legislator. This is why Kant, while conceding that we may call God a legislator, denies that God is the author of the moral law.
- Kant describes the pursuit of one’s own perfection and the happiness of others as duties of virtue, as opposed to right. His division between duties of virtue and of right seems to affirm a division that Leibniz rejects. 
- Butler believes Clarke goes too far in rejecting naturalism; the restoration of some aspects of traditional naturalism is Butler’s answer to sentimentalism. Kant’s objections to rationalism are similar to Butler’s in some important ways that are not completely obvious. Once we see these similarities, we can more easily see the ways in which Kant’s answers to the objections do and do not differ from Butler’s return to traditional naturalism. 
- A variation of Hutcheson’s constructivism might substitute a rational procedure for the reactions of the moral sense. This is approximately the form of constructivism favoured by Kant, according to some views of his position
- Balfour relies on the Socratic and Stoic view (later exploited by Kant) that virtue consists in the good use of other goods;







# Difficulties

- Butler, Reid, and Sidgwick say that the rational pursuit of happiness gives us the reason that impartial justice is even more rational that pursuit of happiness. In trying to maintain the rationality of the affection for justice without allowing the rationality of the desire for happiness, Kant weakens his case for the supremacy of justice.
- The non-eudaemonist intellectualist interpretationofScotusanticipatesaKantianargumentforconnectingfreedomwithpractical reason. This argument raises difficulties for Kant that are parallel to some of the difficulties that we have found in trying to make room for Scotus’ voluntarism. Both Scotus and Kant may be better off with a more intellectualist conception of freedom than the one that they tend to accept. 
- Kant departs further than Butler departs from Aristotelian eudaemonism, since he rejects the naturalist account of virtue and the harmony of self-love and conscience. 
- Voluntarism is one element in the Kantian conception of the will. But Kant does not give up the connexion between the will and practical reason. The voluntarist aspects of his position conflict with the intellectualist aspects. He returns to Scotus’ belief that the affection for justice is somehow constitutive of, not simply one possible manifestation of, the freedom of the will; and so some of the objections to Scotus seem to fit Kant as well.
- The question draws attention to an important aspect of eudaemonism. We might wrongly take a eudaemonist to rely on an empirical, though universal, feature of human beings, that they desire happiness. This is how Kant interprets the desire for happiness.
