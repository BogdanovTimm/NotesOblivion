- Kant uses a counterfactual argument somewhat similar to Plato’s to argue that agents lack a good will and that their actions lack moral worth if they choose to do what duty requires for the sake of its good consequences. He concludes that we have a good will only if we choose ‘duty for duty’s sake’, so that we choose what is morally required precisely because it is morally required and not because of some further aspect of it that is not essential to its being morally required
- Rejects the supremacy of reasons based on one’s own good for being moral
- Non-eudamonism moralism is true: happiness is not needed for a sufficient justification of virtue.
- Against sentimrntalism, Kant argues that rational agents deserve respect from others, irrespective of anyone’s sympathies.
- We might even agree that virtue requires the choice of the right action for the right reason, looking to the very fact that makes the action right. This demand might be understood, as Kant understands it, non-teleologically, so that it does not refer to any connexion between virtuous action and one’s ultimate end.
- Apart from our moral beliefs, we have no reason to attribute freedom to human beings
- Kant’s contrast between acting on duty and acting on other motives: The two people he contrasts with the person acting out of duty are the trader who does the honest thing for the sake of his business and the philanthropist who acts out of his generous sentiments. The action of the philanthropist lacks moral worth not because it is selfish, but because his reason for doing the generous action rests ultimately on his generous impulses; if he lacked them, he would have lost his reason for these actions. Kant is primarily concerned with the distinction that Aquinas draws in his account of intellectual love.
- Pufendorf, then, seems to be open to the objections that Cudworth raises against Hobbes. Kant summarizes these objections in claiming that positive law presupposes natural law.⁴⁶ We might not agree with Kant’s claim that the ground of the authority of a legislator of positive law must be moral, and therefore must be part of natural law. But his claim is plausible if we consider a legislative theory of the natural moral law itself; the non-moral grounds that Pufendorf offers do not vindicate the authority of a moral legislator. Hence at least one natural law cannot itself be valid simply because it has been legislated by a divine legislator. This is why Kant, while conceding that we may call God a legislator, denies that God is the author of the moral law.
- Kant describes the pursuit of one’s own perfection and the happiness of others as duties of virtue, as opposed to right. His division between duties of virtue and of right seems to affirm a division that Leibniz rejects. 
- Butler believes Clarke goes too far in rejecting naturalism; the restoration of some aspects of traditional naturalism is Butler’s answer to sentimentalism. Kant’s objections to rationalism are similar to Butler’s in some important ways that are not completely obvious. Once we see these similarities, we can more easily see the ways in which Kant’s answers to the objections do and do not differ from Butler’s return to traditional naturalism. 
- A variation of Hutcheson’s constructivism might substitute a rational procedure for the reactions of the moral sense. This is approximately the form of constructivism favoured by Kant, according to some views of his position
- Balfour relies on the Socratic and Stoic view (later exploited by Kant) that virtue consists in the good use of other goods;
- considerations suggest that rational intuition of independent sui generis facts is not a satisfactory conclusion for a rationalist to reach. If we find the rationalist position unsatisfactory, we may react in different ways: 
    - We may decide that sentimentalism is right after all.
    - We may decide that the appeal to independent facts is mistaken. This question is connected with a question about the nature of Kant’s rejection of rational intuition; does this lead him to a version of the second reaction as well as the third? Some of his views encourage interpreters to believe that his rejection of rationalism includes the rejection of objectivism. We need to see whether this is Kant’s position, and whether he has a good reason for regarding it as the most reasonable reaction to the intuitionist aspects of rationalism.
    - We may decide that the separation of moral truths from truths about rational agents is mistaken. Kant is dissatisfied both with empiricism and with the rationalism that leads to undefended intuitions. Part of his strategy can be described as an expression of the third reaction; for he takes the connexion between a theory of rational agency and a theory of morality to be much tighter than it appears to be in rationalist conceptions. To this extent he develops a central aspect of Butler’s position (despite his ignorance of Butler) that is obscured by Price and Reid (despite their knowledge of Butler).
Still, Kant does not revive mediaeval naturalism; he rejects it even more clearly than the rationalists do. His rejection is implicit; he does not seriously consider the Aristotelian position defended by Aquinas and his 16th-century supporters, and his explicit references to Greek ethics are rather brief and inexact. We will have to examine his reasons for rejecting the naturalist position, and see how far they leave him from the position common to Aquinas and Butler.
- Kant’s attitude to rationalist intuitionism and sentimentalism in ethics may be compared with his attitude to rationalism and empiricism in metaphysics and epistemology:
    - In the First Critique, he agrees with rationalists against empiricists in believing that there are true non-empirical principles in addition to the truths grasped by experience. But he does not simply assert that these are innate principles, or that they are grasped by rational intuition (Kant criticizes innatism at KrV B167–8). He argues that they are true and non-empirical. In his view, we must recognize their truth and their non-empirical character if we admit any empirical knowledge, or even admit some basic truths about self-consciousness. If he is right, we must reject empiricism if we believe some elementary truths that an empiricist must believe. Kant tries to do something similar in his moral philosophy. He wants to display the rational necessity of the moral point of view, to those who accept moral judgments, or even any plausible conception of rational agency. 
- He argues, therefore, in two different directions (These two different directions of argument should agree in their conclusions. On the one hand, the kind of agent who is presupposed by morality ought to be one whom we can reasonably believe to exist. On the other hand, the principles that a rational agent has reason to accept ought to include recognizably moral principles):
    - ‘regressive’ (or ‘analytic’) - argues from common-sense convictions about morality and moral reasons, to an account of the sort of agent and the sort of will that can be moved by such reasons. Problem 1 is: Granted something about morality, find the sort of will that is determined by it alone.
    - ‘progressive’ (or ‘synthetic’) - The progressive method begins from claims about rational agency — the sorts of agents that we take ourselves to be, and the sorts of reasons that concern us. It argues from these claims to an account of the practical principles that we have reason to accept. Problem 2 is: Granted a free will, find the law that alone is competent to determine it necessarily. 
- The two central concepts that Kant relies on are those of morality and of freedom, which he connects closely with rational agency. Through the moral law we discover the principles that move a will if there is any free will; but we still need some further argument to show that the kind of free will postulated by the moral law is possible.³ 
- We might reasonably compare Kant’s two directions of argument with those that Aristotle distinguishes - one begins from what is ‘more knowable to us’ and proceeds towards the principles that are ‘more knowable by nature’:
    - The principles are ‘more knowable by nature’ because they capture the real explanatory and justifciatory relations between the ordinary convictions we begin with and the less accessible truths that underlie these convictions. A progressive argument setting out from the principles known ‘by nature’ ought not to take the truth of our moral convictions for granted, but ought to justify our conviction of their truth by further principles. In the First Critique, Kant distinguishes a question of fact from a question of right (quid iuris), and takes the second question to require an answer giving a ‘deduction’ that constitutes a justification.⁵ Similar questions seem to be relevant to morality. We find an ‘apparent contradiction between the mechanism of nature and freedom’ (KpV 97). If we could go no further, we would have to conclude that our moral convictions lead us to believe something that we have good reason to reject.
- In Kant’s view, however, the conception of freedom we reach through morality is also reasonable in its own right, and therefore supports the rationality of our moral beliefs. To this extent he offers a ‘deduction’ for practical reason. He claims that our moral beliefs are the foundation of our belief in freedom, and our belief in freedom is the foundation of our moral beliefs. These two claims are consistent, and indeed support each other, if they refer to different types of foundation.
- It seems that Kant did not know about Butler, Balguy and Price.
- Kant knew about Hutcheson, Leibnitz and Wolff
- Kant may knew about Aristotle, Seneca, Cicero and Cudworth.
- To grasp the extent of Kant’s disagreement with sentimentalists, we need to consider whether he rejects their account of practical reason and motivation in general, or only their account of moral reason and motivation.
- If Kant rejects both the ungrounded intuitions of Clarke and Price and the mutability resulting from sentimentalism, we might expect him to consider the position that we have called ‘traditional naturalism’:
    - Kant returns, in one respect, to traditional naturalism - He rejects the immediacy of rightness, as Clarke tries to explain it. In his view, right action is fitting for a rational agent; we cannot see the rightness of an action by inspecting the action in itself, but we must see it in relation to the rational agent who does the action. In recognizing this relational and contextual aspect of rightness, Kant is closer to Butler and to Suarez than to Clarke.
    - On another point, however, he abandons naturalism - He argues that we cannot explain or defend morality through an account of human nature; naturalism tries to rest morality on ‘anthropology’. His explicit objections, however, are not aimed directly at traditional naturalism, but at Humean naturalism. He does not discuss the normative version of naturalism that the Greek moralists, Aquinas, and Butler all accept. Perhaps he agrees with Wollaston and Hume who, despite their sharp disagreements on the nature of morality, agree that a normative conception of nature has no role in an account of morality.
    - Whatever Kant says, it is not always clear that he rejects normative naturalism. Sometimes he simply seems to replace fitness to rational nature with fitness to rational beings. He seems to disagree, therefore, with traditional naturalism only in denying that the rational aspect of rational beings is a feature of their nature. We may wonder whether he is entitled to draw the line between the natural and the non-natural where he does.
- Kant’s conception of the basis of our moral knowledge raises a question about whether he means to defend objectivity or to replace it. He argues that we have a priori knowledge of moral properties; our knowledge rests on necessary features of rational and moral agents. We might say (perhaps exaggerating the parallel with the First Critique) that some moral facts are necessary for the possibility of our experience of ourselves as moral agents.¹⁶ But then we might ask whether these necessary features of our experience tell us about objective moral facts, or simply about our experience. The question about Kant’s realism or anti-realism in the First Critique returns when we consider his practical philosophy.  This comparison with the First Critique needs to consider the differences that Kant sees between theoretical and practical philosophy. Since moral beliefs are not suitably connected to our empirical knowledge, they cannot be about appearances; hence, if they are true about anything, they must be true about things in themselves. But in that case must they not give us knowledge of things in themselves, contrary to the First Critique? Our views about the meta-ethical implications of Kant’s views depend on specific claims about his ethical arguments, and on more general claims about the connexion between his practical philosophy and the rest of his philosophical position. Some of the main interpretative issues can best be decided when we have discussed Kant’s views on freedom. 
- Kant agrees with Butler, Price, and Reid in accepting a rationalist account of the nature and basis of morality, even though he does not rely on intuitionism to support rationalism. He agrees with their view that rationalism conflicts with utilitarianism.
- Perhaps Kant describes the moral point of view at a very general level that is neutral between different normative views.
- Kant contrasts a practical law with a mere maxim. My maxim in doing a particular action is (approximately) my reason for acting as I do. The maxim on which I do this action gives the description under which I choose to do it. If, for instance, I brush my teeth, my maxim is (normally) keeping my teeth clean. We might capture the maxim by saying that I brush my teeth to keep them clean, or that what I am doing in brushing my teeth is keeping my teeth clean (rather than wearing out the brush or exercising my arm).²² A mere maxim, unrelated to any practical law, appeals to a motive that may be present in different rational beings to different degrees. A practical law, by contrast, rests on some ground that applies to rational beings as such.²³ (Kant’s different remarks on maxims and laws seem to reflect some confusion. Sometimes he suggests that a maxim is a subjective principle and a law is an objective principle that we may or may not incorporate in our subjective principle; the law provides a justifying reason that becomes a motivating reason when it is incorporated in our maxim. See G 421n. In this sense both hypothetical and categorical imperatives should give practical laws. But Kant also (in KpV) seems to say that all laws are a priori, and the hypothetical imperative is a mere maxim. Perhaps he confuses different ways something can be subjective). Kant sets out to prove three claims: 
    - A practical law is a principle with a certain form. Kant fulflis his frist task by arguing that no material practical principles are laws (KpV 22), and that a law contains the determining grounds of the will (27). The only such law is the one that requires us to act on a maxim that could be a principle establishing universal law (30). 
    - There are principles with this form, and hence there are practical laws. In drawing a corollary from this ‘fundamental law of practical reason’, Kant fulflis his second and third tasks at once. He asserts that ‘pure reason is practical of itself alone, and it gives (to man) a universal law, which we call the moral law’ (31). 
    - Moral principles rest on practical laws. He does not argue separately that moral principles are practical laws; he explicates his conception of practical laws by reference to assumptions about morality. Suppose that you consider the maxim of denying that a deposit has been made when no one can prove the contrary, and you ask whether this maxim could be a universal law (27). Kant assumes that this question concerns the moral acceptability of the maxim. Similarly, in arguing that a free will must be determined by a pure and unconditional practical law, he appeals to our recognition of our ability to do what we regard as morally obligatory, apart from the comparative strength of our various desires (30). Our awareness of moral obligation is awareness of a practical law.²⁴ 
- Kant claims that principles are practical laws if they rely on some condition that is ‘recognized as objective, i.e., as valid for the will of every rational being’ (KpV 19). He does not mean that all rational agents recognize them as valid. He treats them as justifying reasons, not as exciting reasons, for all rational agents. In his view, not all justifying reasons rest on the desires of the agents for whom they are justifying reasons. Some reasons rest on facts about agents that they may not recognize or care about. Practical laws are valid for the will of every rational being, because of facts about rational beings, not primarily because of what rational beings recognize or desire. 
- Practical principles are laws if they ‘contain the determining grounds of the will because of their form and not because of their matter’. The matter of a practical principle is ‘the object of the will’. Every practical principle has an object whose role determines the character of the principle. If the object is also the determining ground of the will, the principle is not a practical law. In a practical law, the form of the principle, abstracted from the object, gives the determining ground. A purely formal justifying reason distinguishes practical laws from those justifying reasons that depend on some further feature of a specific kind of rational agent. The contrast between form and matter relies on the contrast between empirical desires and reasons that apply to rational agents as such. Kant does not mean to contrast form with content; the distinctive feature of moral principles is not purely ‘formal’, in the familiar sense referring to grammatical or logical form in contrast to content.²¹ Kant means that no particular purpose resting on inclination implies that an action is done from duty; for such a purpose presupposes that the agent already desires the end. The agent’s maxim should have the characteristic, not yet explained, of a genuine moral principle. Kant’s objection to empirical objects of desire is summed up in his claim that we have no antecedent feeling tending to morality.²² If moral reasons relied on antecedent feeling, they would not support our praise and blame of rational agents as such. If they do not rely on antecedent feelings, they are justifying reasons because of their form, as Kant understands ‘form’. We do not yet know how much moral content belongs to reasons that apply to rational agents as such. 
- Kant distinguishes (in order to act, the agent needs both the objective ground and the subjective ground — both a representation of the state of affairs aimed at and a desire to realize it.²⁸):
    - The objective ground of self-determination — the end (Zweck), which is also the ground of determination (Bewegungsgrund) of the action - If someone wants to eat an apple, the eating of the apple is the objective ground; it is the intentional object, or state of affairs represented as desirable. Kant uses ‘objective’ in the Scholastic sense, referring to the object of thought.²⁷ The objective ground need not be an existing object, and need not be valid for all rational agents. It is objective simply because it is a represented state of affairs, rather than an attitude the agent takes to it:
        - Objective ends - External Reasons. Kant connects practical laws with objective, as opposed to subjective, ends. Objective ends have to do with grounds of determination (representation of the state of affairs) that hold good for every rational being. Objective ends do not depend on grounds of determination; they are grounds of determination, as he has said above. He does not mean that objective ends depend on something else, or that they depend on ‘motives’ (as we would normally understand them). With objective ends, the relation between the desire and the desirable object is reversed. Our having a justifying reason to aim at this end does not depend on our already desiring it; on the contrary, it is because we recognize some justifying reason to aim at this end that we come to desire it. Objective ends are those ends, in which the reason is antecedent to the desire. Not all objective ends apply to all rational agents as such. If there are ends that certain kinds of rational beings have reason to pursue, not all objective ends are valid for every rational being in the sense Kant has in mind -  perhaps, for instance, agents who have some considerable degree of artistic, musical, or athletic talent have some reason (not necessarily overriding) to develop it, irrespective of what they may already desire. This external reason is an appropriate basis of action for some, but not all, rational agents. An objective end is therefore a limiting condition of everyone’s freedom of action (G 430–1). Our freedom of action is the freedom to pursue the subjective ends we may have; the objective end limits, but does not supersede, the pursuit of subjective ends. 
        - Subjective ends - Internal Reasons. Though subjective ends ‘rest on’ incentives (motives in contemporary English), they are not themselves incentives, but the states of affairs we aim at. We have subjective ends in so far as some things become desirable to us because we already desire them; this is the only way, according to Hume, in which an end can become desirable to us. In these cases, we can distinguish the desire or ‘spring’ (incentive) from the desirable state of affairs, and the desire is prior.
    - The subjective ground of desire (Begehren) — the incentive (or ‘spring’, Triebfeder) that causes me to do the action. The ‘incentive’ is the agent’s desire for the object. We often use ‘motive’ as Kant uses ‘incentive’ here,
- An agent’s purpose (desire to realize the state of affairs) or object (representation of the state of affairs) cannot belong to a practical law, because Kant has a narrow conception of purposes and objects. In his view, they are all the products of empirical desires and impulses, and therefore are empirical objects of the will. These empirical objects may vary from one agent to another (whether or not they actually vary). If they were the basis of moral principles, the reasons given by moral principles would also vary according to the different desires of different agents. These empirical objects could not support practical laws. But this conclusion might still allow an object of desire to be the basis of practical laws. ‘Object of desire’ might refer either to what a given agent desires or to what is desirable for, or ought to be desired by, this sort of agent. If something is desirable for all rational agents as such, whether or not they desire it, it could be the basis, for all Kant has said so far, of practical laws. Kant has not shown that there can be no such object of desire; and therefore he has not shown that no object of desire could be a basis for practical laws. 
- Kant assumes that practical laws must be known a priori, but he gives no distinct argument for this claim. He refers to ‘the necessity which is conceived in every law, an objective necessity arising from a priori grounds’ (KpV 26), and remarks that ‘practical laws ... must have an objective and not just subjective necessity, and ... must be known a priori by reason instead of by experience’ (KpV 26). They must be known a priori because they apply to rational agents as rational.²⁹ Practical laws are derived from the ‘universal concept of a rational being generally’ (G 412); we can understand them without reference to mere empirical facts about human beings. 
- Kant’s contrast between price and dignity (G 434–5) draws the same distinctions as with Objective and Subjective ends. Whatever has a price has relative value; its price is what it would take for me to give it up in favour of some other goal. Something of absolute value cannot have that sort of price. Kant assumes that price is fxied by degree of antecedent desire; I fnid the price of x when I fnid some y such that I want y more than I want x and I would have to give up y in order to keep x. Objective ends do not have this sort of price, since their value is not fixed by the strength of the desire that I happen to have for them; and so they have a different kind of value from the value attached to things with a price.
- The basis of Kant’s division between practical laws and maxims, and between objective and subjective ends, is also the basis of his division between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. This division rests on the relation of different imperatives to empirical motives and inclination. When Kant speaks of imperatives, he refers to laws as they apply to agents who have motives that potentially conflict with practical reason. Practical laws move purely rational agents without being imperatives, but they are imperatives in agents who have potentially conflicting sources of motivation.³³ Kant normally discusses agents for whom practical laws are imperatives, since all human agents belong to this class. But his claims about reasons and about moral goodness do not require the potential internal confilct that is needed for imperatives.³⁴ :
    - Hypothetical imperative - counsel, rather than command. results from justifying reasons that rest on some particular empirical desire or impulse. Hypothetical imperatives depend on an antecedent inclination. This inclination may be actual, not merely possible. ‘Since you want x, you ought to do y’ is a hypothetical imperative no less than ‘If you want x, you ought to do y’ is.³⁵ The relevant inclination may even be unavoidable. The desire for happiness is universal and necessary for human beings with our specific mental and physical characteristics, but it results in hypothetical imperatives (G 417). This explanation of the difference between categorical and hypothetical imperatives suggests that hypothetical imperatives rest ultimately on a desire for pleasure. This particular feature of Kant’s position, however, is not necessary for his main contrast between the two types of imperatives.⁴¹ 
    - Categorical  imperative - relies on justifying reasons that are independent of empirical desires. A practical law is based on a reason that is independent of the agent’s desires and inclinations. It must present external justifying reasons that are reasons for all rational agents as such, not because some rational agents have the particular aims and needs that human beings have. Such reasons do not cease to be reasons simply because human inclinations change. If we care less about our happiness today than we did yesterday, such a fluctuation of inclination makes different hypothetical imperatives apply to us, but it does not change the practical laws that apply to us as rational agents. Kant’s treatment of happiness makes it especially clear why we need to distinguish two features of categorical imperatives (These two criteria for a categorical imperative are equivalent only if we accept some controversial features of Kant’s view of external reasons. In his view, all non-moral reasons are internal reasons, so that the only external reasons are moral reasons applying to all rational agents as such. But we might reasonably suppose that some of them meet the broader, but not the narrower, criterion for being categorical. Some imperatives apply to some rational agents and not to others, but not because of different preferences. These imperatives might include: (a) People with musical talent ought to develop it. (b) After that serious illness, you ought to take it easy for a while. These imperatives seem to rest on external reasons, independent of any prior preference of the agent; and so, by this test, they are not hypothetical, but categorical. But they seem to apply to some agents and not to others, not to all rational agents as such. One might reply that these imperatives based on external reasons may really apply to all rational agents. Perhaps all rational agents as such have reason, if they have musical talent, to develop it. This ‘conditional’ categorical imperative is different from a hypothetical imperative, because the condition it includes does not involve the agent’s desires. The fact that all imperatives based on external reasons apply to all rational agents in this sense may make it easier for Kant to believe that his narrower conception of a categorical imperative includes all non-hypothetical imperatives. Kant’s conception of a categorical imperative, however, normally requires not this conditional universality, but unconditional universality; he takes a categorical imperative to rest on an external reason that applies unconditionally (i.e., without essentially referring to any conditions distinguishing one rational agent from another) to all rational agents as such. His claims about the features of a categorical imperative apply to unconditionally universal categorical imperatives. ): 
        - Kant’s broader account of a categorical imperative takes every non-hypothetical imperative to be categorical. 
        - His narrower conception restricts categorical imperatives to those that rely on reasons that are equally reasons for all rational agents as such. 
- How many practical laws are there? Kant has clear reasons to deny that technical imperatives, concerned with the satisfaction of particular empirical desires, are practical laws. His reasons for dismissing pragmatic imperatives, derived from happiness, need closer examination.
- The objections to principles based on happiness rest on objections to all ‘practical principles which presuppose an object (material) of the faculty of desire as the determining ground of the will’. In Kant’s view, no such principle can be the basis of moral principles (KpV 21). The ‘material of the faculty of desire’ is an object whose reality is desired. If the desire for the object precedes any practical rule, the principle is empirical. In such cases, pleasure presents an end for the practical rule to achieve. The practical rule, therefore, is merely empirical, because we cannot know a priori whether or not we will gain pleasure.³⁶ 
- Empirical Principle - Principle, in which the desire for the object precedes any practical rule. In such cases, pleasure presents an end for the practical rule to achieve. The practical rule, therefore, is merely empirical, because we cannot know a priori whether or not we will gain pleasure.³⁶
- Material practical principles - aim at pleasure. Kant claims that they all belong under ‘the general principle of self-love or one’s own happiness’ (22). He identifeis pleasure with the ‘sensation of agreeableness’ produced by the achievement of some objects of desire.³⁷ 
- Principle of Self-Love - principle, which make a happiness (rational being’s consciousness of the agreeableness of life which without interruption accompanies his whole existence) the supreme ground for the determination of choice (Willku¨r). ‘We find now, however, our nature as sensuous beings so characterized that the material of the faculty of desire (objects of the inclination, whether of hope or fear) first presses upon us; and we find our pathologically determinable self, although by its maxims it is wholly incapable of giving universal law, nonetheless — as though it constituted our whole self — striving from the start to make its claims primarily and originally valid. This propensity to make oneself, in accordance with the subjective determining grounds of one’s choice (Willku¨r), into the objective determining ground of the will (Wille) in general one can call self-love (Selbstliebe), which, if self-love makes itself legislative and makes itself into the unconditioned practical principle can be called self-conceit (Eigendu¨nkel).’ In doing this, we mistakenly suppose that we need no further reason apart from inclination in order to have a good reason to act on our inclinations. Self-love exaggerates its importance even more when it ‘makes itself legislative and makes itself into the unconditioned practical principle’; this exaggerated attitude is ‘self-conceit’. Self-love and self-conceit differ in that self-love regards one’s own interest as an objective determining ground, without claiming that it is the supreme determining ground, whereas self-conceit claims supremacy for one’s own interest in contrast to any other motive (73).⁴⁷ In both attitudes, the rational will accepts maxims that aim at the satisfaction of inclination, on the false assumption that these maxims give us an objective determining ground. An objective determining ground would give us good reason, apart from our inclinations, to promote our own happiness. If happiness does not give us an objective determining ground, it does not give us external reasons—considerations that constitute good reasons for action, independently of the inclinations of the subject. This conception of happiness requires the Humean conception of hypothetical imperatives, even though Kant himself does not unambiguously endorse this conception.⁴⁸ 
- Assertorical Imperative - The hypothetical imperative which represents the practical necessity of action as means to the promotion of happiness. We may not expound it as merely necessary to an uncertain and a merely possible purpose, but as necessary to a purpose which we can a priori and with assurance assume for everyone because it belongs to his essence.’
- Kant accepts a hedonist account of happiness, identifying happiness with the awareness of durable and uninterrupted pleasure. Some of Kant’s remarks, however, suggest a non-hedonist conception of happiness. Knowledge of happiness rests on ‘mere data of experience’ (KpV 36), and it is difficult to find the elements of happiness (G 417–18).³⁸ This difficulty would not arise if happiness consisted entirely in the pleasure resulting from the satisfaction of desire; for in that case the only constituent element of happiness would be pleasure, and the diffciulty would lie not in identifying the elements of happiness, but in fniding the means to happiness. Perhaps, however, we should take Kant to be speaking inexactly in suggesting that the elements of happiness itself are difficult to find. He may simply mean that it is difficult to discover what gives us pleasure.³⁹ Kant has shown that happiness, as he understands it, does not support categorical imperatives or practical laws, as he understands them.
- A hedonist analysis of desire supports Kant’s claim that no principle based on the agent’s highest good can be a practical law.⁴⁰ If this analysis is right, his criticism of happiness is cogent. If practical rules are prescriptions for achieving happiness, they depend on the agent’s feelings of pleasure.
- Kant contrasts:
    - Judgments of Weal - good assessed by reference to effectiveness in satisfying inclination (in the short or the long term) 
    - Judgments of Strict Goodness - good assessed by reason independently of inclination
- If happiness consists in the satisfaction of our inclinations (or most of them, or those we care most about, or a consistent set of them), judgments about what is required for happiness refer to the goodness that depends on inclination, and hence refer to weal rather than to strict goodness. In Kant’s view, the necessity of our pursuing happiness is a necessity of the human condition, not of practical reason, so that it depends on empirical facts about the strength of our inclinations.⁴³ 
- Imperatives based on happiness manifest our predisposition to humanity; the self-love that aims at happiness ‘is rooted in a reason which is indeed practical, but only as subservient to other incentives’. Only the predisposition to personality, involving the capacity for respect for the moral law as in itself a sufficient incentive of the will, is really ‘rooted in reason practical of itself, i.e., in reason legislating unconditionally’
- Kant’s treatment of reasons of self-interest is not completely clear. We need to distinguish three possible places for reason in prudential deliberation: 
    - Given that you want x, reason tells you that y is a means to x - Kant accepts it.
    - Reason tells you that it is reasonable to pursue y, given that you want x and y is a means to x - One might be inclined to ascribe the second claim to him.⁴⁵ He seems to suppose it is rational to pursue means to our ends, and that we do not need a further inclination in order to make this rational. If, however, we cannot plausibly accept the second claim without the third, Kant’s position is unstable. Though he is fairly clear about the sort of reason provided by a hypothetical imperative, he is less clear about the rationality of following hypothetical imperatives. 
    - Reason tells you that it is reasonable to pursue y, given that x is good for you, and y is a means to x - He rejects the third claim, since he rejects categorical imperatives of prudence. 
- Kant’s treatment of happiness makes it especially clear why we need to distinguish two features of categorical imperatives: (1) Kant’s broader account of a categorical imperative takes every non-hypothetical imperative to be categorical. (2) His narrower conception restricts categorical imperatives to those that rely on reasons that are equally reasons for all rational agents as such. 
- though Kant sees that the ancients regard the highest good (virtue and pleasure), rather than happiness (which is the pleasure), as the ultimate end, he still believes that they subordinate practical reason to inclination. In his view, the appeal to the highest good is an appeal to an object of inclination that can yield only hypothetical imperatives.⁵³ Hence the ancients introduce the ‘heteronomy’ of practical reason, because they do not allow practical reason to follow its own laws, but they make it subservient to inclination.⁵⁴ 
- Kant’s separation of practical laws from inclination-based maxims matches Aquinas’ division between the desires that belong to the will and those that belong to the passions. Aquinas agrees that practical reason is capable of fniding ends that apply to us independently of antecedent non-rational inclinations, and that we are capable of acting on them. But he holds, contrary to Kant, that one’s own good is a source of practical laws, as Kant conceives them. Kant rejects this view because he identifies one’s good with the satisfaction of inclination. On this issue, Kant is less rationalist than eudaemonist naturalists are.
- Kant does not endorse Hume’s general objections to external justifying reasons. Kant believes that moral imperatives give external reasons. He assumes that agents deserve criticism for acting against reason, whatever their inclinations may have been, if they violate principles of morality. If they did not deserve it, the imperative of morality would not be categorical. 
-  He defends claims about external reasons that we might accept without believing that all and only moral principles are practical laws. The next stage in a clear presentation of Kant’s position ought to show how moral principles are practical laws. Kant offers two sorts of arguments for this conclusion about moral principles:
    - Our views about morality, reasons, praise, and blame imply that moral principles are practical laws. We may begin, therefore, with the description of our moral beliefs that Kant takes to support his first claim. In the Groundwork, he begins by claiming that the good will is the only sort of good that we can regard as good ‘without limitation’ (He does not mean that a good will is the only thing that has non-consequential (and in that sense ‘intrinsic’) goodness; he means that we take moral goodness to mark the limit of the goodness of other things). Some things are good only for their consequences, and these lack unconditional goodness. Some things, in particular some traits of character, ‘are not only good in a number of aspects, but seem actually to constitute a part of the inner worth of the person’. Kant comments that the ancients esteemed them unconditionally; he does not reject this unconditional esteem. These goods lack unlimited goodness, because they become bad if they are not controlled by a good will (394). A good will, by contrast, does not become bad when it fails to achieve some good that we value from some non-moral point of view. The traditional doctrine that Kant endorses here treats the moral virtues as expressing a critical point of view on other goods. We need some basis for regulating our use of other goods, since we recognize that in some cases their unregulated use can lead to bad results. The point of view from which we recognize the bad results of bad use of other goods is the point of view from which we recognize the supreme principles of practical reason. The Platonic, Aristotelian, and Stoic tradition, accepted by Aquinas, takes this point of view to be our view of the ultimate end. Kant rejects this eudaemonist interpretation of the supreme principles of practical reason. We have already seen some of his reasons. Since his disagreement with the ancients about misuse actually points out a crucial area of agreement, we may fnid that he differs from traditional eudaemonism less than we might suppose from his explicit remarks. Since the goodness recognized in moral evaluation is not subordinate to any other sort of goodness, it is unconditionally good. It cannot depend on the actual achievement of results external to morality; for if it did depend on them, it would simply be another resource for acquiring further goods. Hence the goodness recognized from the moral point of view consists at least partly in moral virtue itself. As the ancient moralists claim, moral virtue is to be chosen for its own sake as a non-instrumental good that is not subordinate to other goods. Kant captures this point by claiming that the unlimited goodness recognized from the moral point of view consists in the good will.⁷ This goodness is an object of moral praise apart from its results. Once he has identified the will that is open to praise and blame from the moral point of view, Kant asks what makes it praiseworthy and blameworthy. Since wills differ from one another in their maxims, we need to find the maxim that makes one sort of agent morally praiseworthy.⁹ By treating the morally good will as an object of praise, Kant introduces the aspects of morality that make moral imperatives categorical. He implicitly distinguishes three different, but connected roles of morality (If we are related to morality in any one of these ways, must we be related to it in the other two ways as well? Not all benefciiaries of morality, and not all moral subjects, guide their actions by morality. Nor, apparently, need all benefciiaries be moral subjects; animals, children, or people with severe mental handicaps might be exceptions.¹⁰ Still, the three classes defnied by these three relations to morality overlap considerably. This overlap does not seem coincidental. Though we do not assume that we must ourselves benefti from every action required by morality, we do not assume that we are required to conform to morality and evaluated in the light of it, simply because other people find it convenient, apart from any reason of our own, to impose these requirements on us. We are inclined to assume that moral principles are those that every moral subject has a reason to accept. We assume that responsible agents are open to moral evaluation. If our assumption is right, every responsible agent has reason to be a moral agent. Kant believes that every rational agent has a reason to follow the principles that support justifeid praise and blame; the principles that a critic can reasonably apply are also those that an agent can reasonably follow. If Kant is right about this, and if a responsible agent is open to this sort of praise and blame, justifying reasons for accepting moral principles are good reasons for every responsible agent. If Kant is wrong, it seems unfair and arbitrary to blame an agent for violating moral principles. He needs to show that sort of goodness that is open to praise/blame consists in being guided by principles that all rational agents have reason to accept. ):
        - Persons are moral agents        - they guide their actions by moral principles. 
        - Persons are moral beneficiaries - their interests are considered in moral principles. 
        - Persons are moral subjects      - moral principles apply to them, and we evaluate their actions morally. 
    - We can see (without relying on the truth of our moral views) that moral principles are practical laws. It is more difficult to defend the second claim than to defend the first.
- Kant claims that from the moral point of view we praise those who act ‘from duty’: they do what is morally required because it is morally required, not because of some distinct inclination. They recognize what is morally required, and they believe that its being morally required is a suffciient reason for doing the action, no matter what else may be said for or against it. If they are right to believe this, morality gives us justifying reasons independent of non-moral aims and desires. 
- Kant distinguishes three types of people: 
    - those who do what is morally required, but for some purely instrumental reason; 
    - those who do what is morally required because of some direct inclination to the action that is (in fact) in accordance with duty; 
    - those who do what is morally required because it is morally required, and therefore act ‘from duty’ - Kant illustrates this point from a person who is not philanthropic by nature, but beneftis others because it is required by morality. Kant does not mean, however, that in someone who acts from duty the moral motive opposes all others. Opposition is a part of the experiment intended to reveal the distinctness of the moral motive; it is not a requirement for a morally good will. The heuristic role of the examples does not imply that the moral motive is always opposed to other motives.¹⁵ This account of acting from duty is meant to show we appropriately praise and blame moral agents quite generally, without restricting our praise and blame to a particular subset of rational agents. If Kant is right, the morally praiseworthy motive does not require any feeling or sentiment that might not belong to all rational agents. If Kant is right, the morally praiseworthy motive does not require any feeling or sentiment that might not belong to all rational agents. The justifying reasons provided by morality are not subordinate to reasons that have a non-moral source. Kant rejects Hume’s view that I have a justifying reason to do x if and only if I have a prior desire (independent of reasons for doing x) to do y, and doing x is a means to doing y. 
- According to Kant, the sentimentalist view reverses the proper connexion between moral reasons and moral sentiments. Sometimes the loss of a sentiment or inclination deprives me of all the reason I had; if, for instance, I lose my taste for jazz, I also lose my reason to buy jazz records. But someone who lacks the relevant sentiment in favour of morality has reason to acquire the sentiment, because he has reason to act morally.¹⁷ Similarly, someone who loses a pro-moral sentiment still has reason to act morally. It is diffciult, in any case, for sentimentalists to identify the appropriate pro-moral sentiment. They cannot say that it is the sentiment evoked by the conviction that we have moral reason to do this action. It must be a sentiment that is independent of such convictions, if it is to be the source of justifying reasons. Hutcheson suggests benevolence and the approval of benevolence. Hume suggests the sentiment of humanity. But it does not seem obvious that the action we think morally justified will also excite this sort of sentiment.¹⁸ Kant points out that sometimes the morally right action not only fails to excite our benevolence, but actually repels us, because our normal sympathetic feelings have been extinguished or diverted. He argues that these facts about our feelings do not cancel the moral obligation. We are therefore sometimes justified in praising and blaming people independently of the strength of their inclination to care about morality; we think our blame is appropriate for agents who lack pro-moral feelings. But if our blame is appropriate, then:
   - the agents must be responsible for their actions, and so capable of modifying them in the light of blame
   - there must be some good reason for them to modify their actions. Kant accepts the second claim because he believes that, contrary to Hume, justifeid praise and blame are different from expressions of our preferences or our invitations to other people to do what we would prefer them to do. If the blame is really justified, some principles make it reasonable for the agents themselves to agree with us about what they should do. 
- If my action is to express a moral principle, it has some specifc ipurpose; if we act from duty we give money (e.g.) in order to relieve someone’s need, not to enhance our own reputation. But in this case the moral principle we act on determines the purpose, not the other way round.
- Moral principles are therefore knowable a priori. Since they apply to rational agents as such, not to rational agents with some feature that is inessential to being a rational agent, they give justifying reasons to rational agents, irrespective of empirical features. For the same reasons, they are categorical imperatives; for they apply to rational agents, not to rational agents with some further inclination that gives them reason to accept moral principles.
- Our conception of moral praise and blame presupposes that moral reasons are based on practical laws. Moral praise and blame rest on the appropriate moral principles only if these moral principles are practical laws, giving reasons to rational agents as such, irrespective of the specific desires and inclinations of individuals.
- Moral Principles = Practical Laws = Categorical Imperatives
- Now, Kant did not show that moral catagorical imperatives exists. To prove that there are moral categorical imperatives, Kant needs to argue in three stages: 
    1) He should indicate what a moral categorical imperative will say, if there is any such thing. Hence he should find a plausible supreme principle of morality. 
    2) He should show that this principle is not simply a hypothetical imperative, because it does not give us a justifying reason by appeal to some antecedent non-moral preference. 
    3) He should show that it is a categorical imperative. For this purpose, it is not enough to show that it is not a hypothetical imperative; we must also have some reason to accept it independently of whatever else we happen to desire. This reason has to be equally good for every agent who is an appropriate object of justifeid praise and blame.²⁶ 
- To grasp the concept of a hypothetical imperative is not to grasp the specific principles that are hypothetical imperatives. In the case of the categorical imperative, however, Kant asks ‘whether perhaps the mere concept of a categorical imperative may not also supply us with the formula containing the proposition that can alone be a categorical imperative’ (G 420). His answer to this question is Yes; for consideration of the concept of a categorical imperative yields a statement of the one categorical imperative. Since the concept of a categorical imperative is the concept of a law for all rational agents, the one categorical imperative is the principle that requires acting in accord with a universal law for all rational agents.²⁷ This Formula of Universal Law, therefore, satisfies the concept of a categorical imperative. 
- According to Kant, the universal law ‘contains no condition to which it is limited’. He relies on his original claim that the good will is the only unlimited good.²⁸ It is good without limitation, because it expresses the moral point of view from which we see the limits on other goods; hence moral imperatives rest on reasons that are not limited by non-moral preferences. When Kant denies that the moral law is limited by any condition, he means that it does not depend on some agent’s having some particular antecedent preference giving her a specific purpose. Hence, any categorical imperative must rely on some reason that is independent of antecedent preferences. Since this reason is equally good for all rational agents, irrespective of their preferences, it is a universal law for all rational agents.
- Since Kant uses the concept of a categorical imperative to determine the goodness of an agent’s will, he must connect it with the agent’s maxim, and so with the reason that the agent acts on. Hence he formulates the categorical imperative with reference to a maxim: ‘Act only according to the maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law’ (G 421).³⁰ To decide whether a maxim ‘can’ be willed to be a universal law or ‘can’ become a universal law, Kant asks whether its becoming a universal law would involve some sort of contradiction. But the nature of the contradiction is not clear. Kant offers an example of deceitful promising. Someone moved by self-love acts on the maxim, ‘When I believe myself to be in need of money, I will borrow money and promise to repay it, although I know I shall never do so’. This maxim could not become a universal law, because the universalized maxim would involve a contradiction. If the maxim were treated as a universal law, everyone would know that everyone made promises on this assumption. Knowing this, people would be unwilling to accept promises; and so the whole practice of promising, on which the deceitful promisor relies, would collapse. Since the deceitful promisor’s maxim both presupposes promises and (if universalized) undermines promises, the universalized maxim contains a contradiction.³¹ This example suggests what Kant has in mind in speaking of a contradiction in willing. He does not intend a purely logical interpretation; for contradiction in willing does not require the acceptance of inconsistent propositions. It would be inconsistent to say both ‘I will make a promise’ and ‘No one will make a promise’, but it is consistent to make a promise on a maxim that would, if universalized, make it diffciult or impossible to make promises. Perhaps, then, Kant has in mind a practical contradiction; I will a particular action, but also will the existence of conditions that make it difficult to perform the action, so that my policy is self-defeating even if it is consistent. In that case, Kant might be describing the adoption of policies that would be self-defeating if they were universalized; he suggests that these are the ones that are morally unacceptable. This sort of contradiction, however, does not make a policy irrational, and so it does not seem obvious that the avoidance of such contradiction is a universal law for rational agents. Even if the universalization of my maxim would be self-defeating, the maxim need not be self-defeating. If it is most improbable that everyone will act on my maxim, why should I, as a rational agent, reject it? One might argue that Kant intends simply to propose a test of moral acceptability, so that a maxim is to be rejected if its universalization is self-defeating. He does not mean (on this view) that acting on the maxim is irrational in any further sense. This way of understanding Kant’s test faces two objections: (1) It is not clear why the avoidance of these morally unacceptable maxims is a categorical imperative, since it is not clear why all rational agents have a reason to avoid them. (2) It is not even clear that all policies that would be self-defeating if universalized are morally wrong. If I like to walk in a deserted place, the fact that it would not be deserted if other people knew about it does not make my current preference wrong. These objections ignore one feature of Kant’s example. If I walk where other people do not walk, I am (we may suppose) not taking any unfair advantage of them. But in making a promise I do not intend to keep, I take unfair advantage of people’s general willingness to keep rules that I do not want to keep. The fact that promise-breakers make an unjustifeid and unfair exception for themselves is exposed by the self-defeating character of the maxim when it is universalized. This answer may deal with some apparent counter-examples, but it does not vindicate Kant’s appeal to universal law and to contradiction. It shows that these tests will pick out some morally wrong actions only if we supplement them with some appeal to fairness. If the Formula of Universal Law includes the supplement, it is not obviously a categorical imperative; for it is not obvious that the supplement provides a reason for all rational agents as such. From a sentimentalist point of view, the supplement that introduces fairness shows that Kant needs to rely on some sentiment favouring fairness. In that case, the ‘contradiction in willing’ consists in a contradiction between the initial maxim and the universal principle plus the appropriate sentiment. The supposed categorical imperative collapses, therefore, into a hypothetical imperative: if we care about fairness, we cannot consistently accept the maxim allowing false promises. If this answer to Kant is right, he cannot derive a categorical imperative with the moral content that he wants. If the Formula of Universal Law could not be violated without inconsistent willing (‘Let there be promises and let there be no promises’), it would be a categorical imperative, but it would lack the appropriate moral content.³² Moral content apparently cannot be derived from rational agency alone, but must come from an empirical motive—in this case, from some sentiment favouring fairness. But even if we were to supplement Kant’s formula with a sentiment favouring fairness, we would not have found the supreme principle of morality. For some maxims are open to moral objection, even if they can be willed consistently with a sentiment of fairness. For instance, I can avoid taking unfair advantage of everyone else, if I forgo my own legitimate demands. If I do not care about being humiliated, then the universal law of humiliating people does not seem to introduce any contradiction into my willing, since it does not seem to involve any conflict with fairness. And so either the Formula of Universal Law is open to cogent objections, or we should interpret it differently. Kant offers an interpretation of his formula that responds to these objections. He examines a maxim that neither defeats itself when universalized nor takes unfair advantage of other people, but still—in his view—violates the Formula of Universal Law. He considers a ‘maxim of independence’—the maxim of someone who does not want to help other people. Kant argues that this maxim is unacceptable, because we ‘cannot will’ its universalization, which leaves everyone free to refuse to help others if they feel like refusing.³³ 
- What does Kant mean by saying that we ‘cannot will’ the universalization of the maxim of independence? He admits that the universal law of independence is consistent; it is not self-defeating in the way that a universal law of deceitful promises would be. Nor does the universal law of independence seem to confilct with the desires of all actual people. Even if we cannot give up wanting other people to help us, we might surely want their help less than we want other things, so that we could consistently accept a universal law of independence. And even if a universal law of independence were psychologically impossible for actual people, this would not help Kant in the search for a categorical imperative that gives a reason to all rational agents. Nor does Kant appeal to self-centred egoistic calculation of one’s own interest. Even if he appealed to the effect of the universalized maxim on my hypothetical interests (i.e., those I would have in the situation where the maxim would be universally accepted), the outlook of the Formula would not be egoistic. From a self-centred point of view, I have no reason to be concerned with hypothetical consequences for my interest unless these are also likely. If I consider the impact of a universal law on everyone’s interest, I am not concerned simply with my own interest. Nor does Kant consider total utility. He does not ask whether the total consequences of the universal law of independence would be worse than the consequences of some other universal law. He simply asks us to consider whether we ‘can will’ the universal law. 
- Kant claims that we ‘cannot will’ the universal law of laziness.³⁴ He argues that, as rational beings, we necessarily will the development of our talents. By this he does not mean that all actual rational beings want to develop their talents. He means that refusal to develop talents refelcts an empirical preference that would be rejected by a rational agent who is guided by the outlook of rational agents as such.
- In rejecting the maxims of independence and laziness, Kant distinguishes his categorical imperative from the Golden Rule. We might have thought that the Formula of Universal Law, in the example of false promising, expresses the Golden Rule, prohibiting us from endorsing actions that we would not want to allow other people to do to us. Kant, however, dismisses the Golden Rule as ‘trivial’.³⁵ In distinguishing his principle from the Golden Rule, he denies that fairness of the sort that is consistent with the maxims of independence and laziness adequately captures the categorical imperative. When he asks what someone ‘can will’ or what ‘can be’ a universal law, he answers from the point of view of a rational agent as such. Though particular rational agents may put up with all sorts of universal laws, only some of these are laws that rational agents, as such, can will.
- Any practical law must be a law for all rational agents as such; and so any maxim that conforms to a practical law must be a maxim that we can will, from the point of view of rational agents as such, to be a universal law.
- To explain the Formula of Universal Law, Kant introduces a second formula of the categorical imperative, the ‘Formula of Humanity’, which requires us to treat persons as ends in themselves. He reaches the conception of an end in itself by introducing the idea of an objective end that is an end for all rational agents. The only objective end is humanity. Hence the only categorical imperative is the one that prescribes treatment of persons as objective ends, and hence as ends in themselves. Kant re-examines the examples that illustrate the Formula of Universal Law, and argues that in each case the prohibited maxim violates the Formula of Humanity, because it treats people as means to some further end, and not as ends in themselves. Kant re-examines the examples that illustrate the Formula of Universal Law, and argues that in each case the prohibited maxim violates the Formula of Humanity, because it treats people as means to some further end, and not as ends in themselves (G 429). Suicide just for the sake of avoiding distress undervalues the rational aspect of persons, and treats them purely as subjects of pleasure and pain. The categorical imperative goes beyond mere reciprocity and so excludes the rejection of mutual aid (in the third example). It is not simply the Golden Rule (G 430n). Since rational beings want concern for rational beings to be reciprocated, they reject complete subordination of rational beings to one person’s interests.³⁸  In Kant’s treatment of the third and fourth examples, the Formula of Humanity is needed to explicate the previous formulae. If the previous formulae (Universal Law and Law of Nature) prescribe merely consistent willing, they do not exclude maxims that Kant wants to exclude.³⁹ If, however, the categorical imperative requires non-instrumental concern for the interests and aims of rational beings in their own right, it excludes consistent policies that subordinate the interests and aims of some rational beings to the subjective ends of anyone. The Formula of Humanity expresses this aspect of the categorical imperative. In the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant uses this formula to explain duties to oneself and others; it demands respect both for one’s own humanity and for the humanity of others.⁴⁰ 
- Kant argues that if moral principles express a categorical imperative, they must rest on an objective end. As we have seen, his separation of objective from subjective ends separates those ends that give reasons only on the basis of an antecedent desire from the ends that give reasons independent of desires. But this minimal conception of an objective end does not yet show that objective ends must be ends for all rational agents as such.⁴² Without some rather controversial assumptions about the nature of ends, the independence of an end from antecedent inclination is only a necessary condition for being suitable for all rational agents as such. Kant wants to show that the objective end relevant to morality is an end for all rational agents as such. The objective end for rational beings must impose a limit on the pursuit of subjective ends. Kant might intend either of two claims (An objective end for all rational agents imposes both kinds of limit on the pursuit of subjective ends. It is ‘the supreme limiting condition of every man’s freedom of action’ (G 431). It provides a ‘supreme practical principle’ (428), so that its demands specify the legitimate degree of satisfaction of our other ends. Returning to his initial contrast between the unlimited goodness of the good will and the limited goodness of other goods, Kant claims that the unlimited goodness prescribes the limits for the pursuit of the limited goods): 
    - The objective end is a source of value distinct from the inclination-dependent value of subjective ends. Since, therefore, it claims some of our attention, it claims to limit the attention we give to subjective ends. 
    - It claims priority over subjective ends; its demands come before the demands
- If all value were the result of antecedent desire, and hence of subjective ends, there would be no supreme practical principle (according to Kant) for reason. If there is such a principle, something must be an end in itself. This end is an object of respect, not appraised simply from the point of view of our inclinations. 
- An objective end is an object of respect, not an end to be achieved. This apparently paradoxical claim is intelligible if we consider different influences on goal-directed action. We may speak in general of the end of our action as the state of affairs whose properties guide us in choosing what to do. The end we seek to achieve obviously satisfies this description; if we want to achieve an end that includes having a wall painted red, we try to get red paint. Things that are not ends we aim to achieve may also guide our choices. Suppose we want to renovate a building, while preserving its original character. The character of the building—the height of the ceilings, the size of the rooms, and so on—constrains the changes we can make in the course of renovation. The original character is not something we try to achieve, since it is already there. But we respect it, if we attribute to it some value that determines the permissible ends we try to achieve and the means we adopt. It is part of the total end that we seek to achieve, since we do not achieve our aims unless we respect the original character of the building; but it is not itself something that we achieve. This example may suggest how morality requires an objective end. The example is not perfectly analogous; for the end that is an object of respect in relation to our plans for renovation may result from inclination. Kant requires an objective end that is an object of respect in relation to every end resulting from inclination. For morality evaluates and criticizes preference-based reasons. It gives us good reasons to act, independently of any antecedent preferences or feelings; these reasons tell us which of our antecedent preferences and feelings we can legitimately act on. Since the objective end has this limiting function, Kant calls it a ‘supreme limiting condition on the pursuit of subjective ends’
- In our conception of a good will we distinguish two kinds of end: 
    - End to be achieved (ein zu bewirkender Zweck)
    - Self-suffciient aka independent end (selbsta¨ndiger Zweck) - We abstract from every end to be achieved, and we are left with an independent end. The only independent end is ‘the subject of all possible ends themselves, because this at the same time is the subject of a possible absolutely good will; for this sort of will cannot without contradiction be subordinated to any other object (Gegenstand)’ (G 437). The subject of all possible ends is a person, who is not merely a means to be arbitrarily used (zum beliebigen Gebrauche) for this or that will (Wille) (G 428). Since persons are not to be used simply as means, they ‘limit all choice’ (alle Willku¨r einschra¨nkt)⁴³ by considerations about rational beings. This objective end for all rational agents is not simply a rival to subjective ends; it also prescribes the legitimate extent of their pursuit. Kant believes he has found the right sort of end by identifying rational agents as objective ends and ends in themselves; their rational agency includes a limit on the pursuit of subjective ends.
- Kant’s argument is rather brief and elliptical. It sets out from the value we attach to a good will apart from its results, and concludes that we treat a rational agent as an objective end. A fuller statement of his argument might be this: 
    1. Suppose that we did not value the rational will as an end in itself, deserving respect in its own right apart from any result it tends to achieve. 
    2. In that case, we would value it in relation to some end to be achieved. 
    3. In that case, it would have purely instrumental value, and we would have no reason to value it in circumstances where it was ineffective. 
    4. But we have reason to value the good will irrespective of whether or not it is effective - Kant appeals (in (4)) to the fact that we value the good will in itself, apart from its instrumental value; he infers that we regard the rational will as an end in itself. Why does his claim about the good will support his claim about the rational will? The answer depends on Kant’s account of what we value in a good will. If a good will were distinct from a rational will, respect for a good will would not imply respect for a rational will, even if only rational wills could be good wills. Kant argues, however, that the good will is good because it responds to the reasons that are good reasons for every rational agent as such, irrespective of any particular empirical inclinations. Hence the good will is a rational will functioning purely as such; and hence, if the rational will being thoroughly rational deserves respect, the rational will itself deserves respect. 
    5. So we must regard it as an end in itself — something that we respect as a limit on the pursuit of other ends. 
- Different argument for the same conclusion sets out from the premiss that we recognize a categorical imperative, and proceeds as follows: 
    1. To accept a categorical imperative is to be guided by a principle appealing to rational agents as such, over principles that appeal to subjective ends.
    2. To be guided by a principle appealing to rational agents as such is to give practical priority to rational agency over subjective ends, so that we act on the requirements of rational agency before fulfliling the demands of any subjective ends - Kant means that when we commit ourselves to a categorical imperative, we accept the claims of rational agency over the claims of subjective ends; the prior considerations are those that matter from the point of view of rational agency, not from the point of view of this or that particular rational agent. It is reasonable to recognize this priority if and only if we value acting on the claims of rational agency over the claims of subjective ends. If we take this attitude, we imply that rational agents, as such, are not subordinate to any subjective end. 
    3. In giving such priority to rational agency, we treat rational agency as an objective end. 
    4. Hence, in accepting a categorical imperative, we treat rational agents, as such, as objective ends, that is, as ends in themselves.⁴⁴ 
- We may express this point in Kantian terms by complicating our previous description of the maxim of one’s action. If I swim just for enjoyment, we might say that my maxim is ‘I’m doing something I enjoy’ or ‘I’m doing it because I enjoy it’, and that it is a morally acceptable maxim; surely there is nothing wrong with swimming just for fun? In Kant’s view, however, this is not the maxim of a person with a good will, since it is not a morally acceptable maxim. If we act on an acceptable maxim, we are responsive to possible moral objections, even if the objections do not arise in this particular case. These moral conditions must be presupposed as the background in which a morally good agent pursues enjoyment. Hence a subjective end alone does not yield a morally acceptable maxim. Hence the maxim that they could will to be a universal law is not (e.g.) ‘Do what you enjoy’, but ‘Do what you enjoy in the right circumstances’, where the right circumstances are those in which no moral objection arises. ToexpressKant’spointaboutsubjectiveends,wemightsaythatanacceptablemaximmust include, or implicitly refer to, conditions that would justify the particular action. The relevant justification includes satisfactory answers to the questions that can be asked about the effects of x on rational agents. Given this conception of a maxim, it follows that if we can justify this action only by reference to some subjective end, our maxim is morally unacceptable. 
- Later remarks suggest that we treat ourselves as ends in so far as we set ends for ourselves.⁴⁵ Setting ends for oneself is a distinguishing mark of a rational agent, and it somehow commits us to regarding ourselves as ends. What is the connexion? If setting ends for oneself is distinctive of rational agents, it is not simply pursuing an end, or aiming at an end, since non-rational animals can do that. ‘Setting ends’ should refer to some rational and deliberate act of choosing an end; this act is peculiar to rational choosers. To set an end for myself, therefore, is not the same as pursuing an end. It differs in two respects: 
    - I set an end and do not simply pursue it - Rational agents who set ends do not act on arbitrary choices. According to Aquinas, rational agents grasp ‘the character of the end’ (ratio finis);⁴⁶ they see what is good about this end in relation to the other ends that they see reason to pursue. If Kant has something similar in mind, he is right to claim that setting an end requires a distinctively rational capacity.
    - I set it for myself -  His second condition, that one sets the end for oneself, also seems to follow Aquinas. In Aquinas’ view, we choose ends as goods in relation to the ultimate good for ourselves. Kant seems to agree that when I set an end as an end for myself, I choose it with myself in mind. To have myself in mind in choosing an end is to rely on some conception of myself and my other ends. A particular end deserves to be chosen not simply because I fnid it appealing in its own right, but because it fits appropriately with my conception of myself and my other ends. I do not want to pursue any particular end to a degree that conflicts with the structure of ends that I attribute to myself; and so I attach greater value to myself than I do to any single end just as such. Kant seems to intend the same conception of choice by a rational agent, when he introduces the duty to aim at one’s own perfection.⁴⁷ If I am a rational agent, I propose an end with myself in mind, and hence in the light of some conception of myself. If I regard myself as a limit on the pursuit of other ends, I rely on a conception of myself that I value as a guide to the choice of other ends. If I value myself, I must also (Kant assumes) value my abilities, and hence seek to realize them. Hence the capacity to set ends for myself supports the demand for cultivation of one’s talents. This argument for development of one’s capacities as a rational agent recalls still another aspect of Aquinas’ description of rational agency. In Aquinas’ view, our pursuit of happiness includes a desire for perfection.⁴⁸ He refers to perfection to make it clear that the rational pursuit of one’s final good does not simply involve the adjustment of some of our desires to others, but also requires some conception of the aspects of oneself that are worth realizing. This conception is one’s idea of perfection. Kant agrees; for he believes that setting ends for oneself implies valuing oneself as a rational agent, and hence valuing one’s rational agency and its development. Given this conception of setting an end for oneself, Kant believes that rational agency implies treating oneself, as a rational agent, as an end in itself. Kant does not imply that my simple choice makes one end more valuable than another, so that the value of particular ends is entirely the product of choice. On the contrary, the reference to choosing ‘for myself’ suggests that it is the character of my self that determines whether one or another choice is correct. My grounds for pursuing one or another end to this or that degree rest partly on its being an end for me; the traits, characteristics, and ends that constitute me are a condition that limits the pursuit of this end. Hence rational agents necessarily regard themselves individually as ends. We can therefore defend Kant’s claims about treating oneself as an end by refelxion on the character of prudential thought in a rational agent.
- In moral choice, one treats oneself as an end not only in relation to one’s own desires, but also in relation to other people’s. This treatment refelcts an individual’s self-respect—a demand for non-instrumental consideration by other people. Such a demand is supported by one’s attitude to oneself in relation to one’s particular passions. In both cases, I value myself above any particular end to be achieved, and I attach this value to myself as a rational agent. It would be unreasonable to suppose that I am a limiting condition for my own subjective ends, but not for other people’s subjective ends; why should the mere fact that they are other people’s ends rather than mine make it reasonable for me to subordinate myself to them? Kant argues that respect for myself as a rational agent also commits me to respect for rational agents, and hence commits me to the treatment of rational agents as ends in themselves. 
- He now suggests that the simple capacity to set ends for themselves does not make them ends in themselves; this status comes only from their morally practical reason.⁴⁹ Here Kant seems to contradict his account in the Groundwork of the sources of human dignity. In other places, too, he distinguishes humanity from personality, claiming that the moral law reveals personality as something that ‘elevates man above himself as a part of the world of sense’ (KpV 86). The demand for persons to be treated as ends in themselves ‘rests on the personality of these beings, whereby alone they are ends in themselves’. Kant contrasts man as phenomenon and man as noumenon, and suggests that personality belongs to the noumenal self, in contrast to the mere humanity that makes us capable of setting ends.
- Later, Kant distinguishes humanity from personality by alluding to different roles of practical reason. His allusions reveal some of the obscurity that we have previously noticed in his discussions of practical reason, prudence, and morality. He alludes to four functions of practical reason (It is not clear, however, how Kant takes these four functions to be related. Does he, for instance, take the maximizing function to be an instance of the instrumental function of practical reason? This question takes us back to an obscurity that we noticed in his treatment of the hypothetical imperative. In speaking of the rationality of maximizing, we might have two different claims in mind: (a) Given that I want to maximize the satisfaction of my inclinations, it is rational for me to find ways to do it. (b) It is rational for me to find ways to maximize the satisfaction of my inclinations. The two claims have different implications if I happen not to care about maximizing the satisfaction of my inclinations. The first claim implies that I have no reason to find ways to maximize, but the second claim implies that it is still rational for me to maximize, even though I do not care about it. If practical reason aims at maximization irrespective of my inclinations about it, it is not purely instrumental to inclination. Hence the second function of practical reason does not seem to be simply an instance of the first function): 
    -It is purely instrumental, finding means to a end given by inclination. 
    - It aims at maximization, at what satisfeis the ‘greatest sum’ of inclinations. 
    - It prescribes ends without reliance on inclination - Kant is equally obscure about the relation between the third and the fourth functions. His only example of the third function is moral practical reason. Does he believe, therefore, that this is the only case in which practical reason can present ends independently of inclinations? It would not be surprising if he believed this, given his assumption that prudence is not a source of categorical imperatives. But if he had been clearer about the difference between the first and the second functions of practical reason, he could not so easily have assumed that the only non-instrumental function is found in morality. 
    - In the moral law, it guides us independently of any other incentive.
- Does he believe that the non-instrumental role of practical reason is the source of dignity in its own right? Or is moral reason the source of dignity, and does Kant treat non-instrumental practical reason as the source of dignity only because it coincides with moral reason? He has good reason to take non-instrumental practical reason itself to be the source of dignity. For he connects morality with a categorical imperative that appeals to rational agents as such. If our attitude to moral practical reason includes an element that cannot be justifeid by appeal to rational agency as such, he defeats his argument about morality. If dignity belongs to moral agents for some reason unconnected with rational agency, moral imperatives do not seem to be categorical imperatives. If, then, Kant attributes dignity exclusively to moral agency, he faces this damaging consequence. He ought to take practical reason itself to be the source of dignity, so that moral agency is a source of dignity because it is rational agency.
- If I respect myself as a rational agent, I have some concern for the rational aims I form in my own interest; even though I could be a rational agent without these particular aims, they are valuable for me as a rational agent partly because I have chosen them. Hence if we value a person’s rational agency, we ought to regard a person’s rational aims and interests as themselves deserving respect, not to be exploited in someone else’s interest. If we see grounds for respecting persons as rational agents, we ought also to respect their interests, and refuse to subordinate their interests to other people’s interests. This connexion between respect for persons as ends and concern for the interests of persons is the source of moral content in the Formula of Humanity.
- Morality is concerned with the interests of persons, and especially with the impact of actions, states of character, and so on, on the interests of persons. If we conceive these interests as simply the satisfaction of inclinations, apart from their relation to the person whose interests they are, we will endorse a utilitarian conception of the morally appropriate end, and suppose that we promote a person’s interest by satisfying inclinations. Kant, however, believes that rational agents care about their own interest because they are agents with a specific identity and specific aims apart from any particular collection of inclinations. The agents who have the aims deserve respect not the aims themselves. This account of interests and respect gives us a further reason to believe that Kant takes rational agency itself, rather than moral goodness, to be the source of dignity. If the only aspect of rational agents that has dignity is their moral goodness, why should respect for this require respect for their interests? Could I not recognize that A is a morally good person and deserves respect for her moral goodness, without supposing that A deserves any particular attention to her aims and interests? In Kant’s view, the respect we owe to a person requires some respect for her aims and interests. If I ascribe dignity to myself, I expect to have my own interests, not simply my moral aims, considered for my sake. That is why he advises: ‘Be no man’s lackey.—Do not let others tread with impunity on your rights’ (MdS 436).⁵² 
- If we exclude it altogether from our understanding of Kant’s principles, we exclude not only empirical elements, but teleological elements in general, from basic moral principles. Kant does not exclude teleology, however. He relies on it in his interpretation of the formulae of the categorical imperative. The Formula of the Law of Nature speaks of a system of nature in which different actions and agents fulfl ithe ends appropriate for them. Consideration of which maxims we can will to be universal laws requires us to refer to the needs of the people involved.⁵³ Kant rejects a conception of the good that is entirely independent of morality, but he accepts a conception that is appropriately infulenced by moral considerations.⁵⁴ To respect people as ends is to consider their interests appropriately.
- As Kant promised, the Formula of Humanity helps to explain the Formula of Universal Law. In particular, it explains what is meant in speaking of what one can or cannot will as a rational being. One wills as a rational being on the basis of justifying reasons that apply to rational agents as such. Kant argues that any such reasons treat rational agents as ends. If, then, there is a categorical imperative, it prescribes treatment of rational agents as ends. This argument does not prove that there is a categorical imperative; for the reasons we take to be valid for rational agents as such may not really be valid for them. The moral point of view asserts the validity of these reasons; but to show that these reasons are valid, we need some further argument that does not simply take the moral point of view for granted. The further argument comes from the connexion between morality and freedom. 
-If Kant succeeds in the parts of his argument that we have considered so far, he has given an account of the moral point of view, though he has not justified it. In his view, morality claims to present categorical imperatives, and we can support this claim by further argument about freedom. If his attempt to support morality fails, we might decide (1) that there are no categorical imperatives, because there are no reasons that apply to rational beings as such, or (2) that there are no categorical imperatives of morality, even though there are non-moral categorical imperatives, or (3) that we cannot give any compelling non-moral reason for accepting or rejecting categorical imperatives of morality. In the first and second cases, Kant’s account of morality supports a nihilist or a sceptical conclusion about morality. In the third case, our conclusion is more complicated. Kant speaks as though we can find some further reason for believing in categorical imperatives beyond the fact that morality requires us to believe in them, though it is not always clear what the further reason is.² But if there is no further reason to be found, we have to decide whether the fact that morality says there is a categorical imperative is a good enough reason by itself for believing in this categorical imperative. 
- If all rational agents are properly open to justifeid praise and blame, moral principles must state good reasons for all rational agents, whether or not particular rational agents happen to care about them.
- Kant does not endorse this extreme view about quantity of effort. He argues that the morally good person’s moral motive must be strong enough to motivate her, even if she were acting in the face of strong conflicting motives. But it may be strong enough to do this even if the strong conflicting motives are absent. Kant mentions cases of actual conflict for illustrative purposes; these cases show the sort of motive that is needed for moral worth. They provide a sign of moral worth, but they need not be the only cases in which someone’s action proceeds from a good will and has moral worth.¹⁴ Kant does not suggest that the degree of actual conflict determines moral worth. 
- A further argument to show why the concurrence of moral and non-moral motives would reduce moral worth might rely on a ‘subtractive’ view of moral worth. According to this view, the goodness of one’s will is measured by the proportion of one’s actual motivation for the action that is purely moral. If, then, part of one’s motivation comes from inclination, this is so much subtracted from the moral worth of the action.¹⁵ This subtractive view differs from the ‘quantity of effort’ view in cases where someone acts on the moral motive and has no non-moral motives either for or against the same action. Though the quantity of effort involved would be less than what would be needed in the case of conflicting motives, the proportion of motivation that is moral would be the same as in cases of conflict. In cases of conflict, the subtractive view gives the same answers as the quantitative view. The implications of the subtractive view for moral education are less extreme than those of the quantitative view, but are still open to question. The subtractive view does not imply that the elimination of conflicting motives reduces someone’s moral worth, but it still implies that any non-moral motive co-operating with the moral motive reduces moral worth. Moral training, therefore, should try to remove conflicting motives; it should not encourage co-operating motives. We have no good reason to ascribe this view to Kant. His examples of conflict do not imply that co-operating non-moral motives reduce moral worth. He says only that their presence is not necessary for a good person’s moral motive. He holds neither the quantitative nor the subtractive view about moral worth, and so he does not face the objections that arise from these views. 
- If non-rational motives matter to morality, but they are entirely non-voluntary and contingent, Kant is wrong about morality, and Hume is right to maintain that the difference between non-voluntary conditions are relevant to the moral evaluation of agents and characters. If Hume is right, good moral characters belong only to agents with certain kinds of feelings and sentiments, contrary to Kant’s claims about the universality of moral principles and moral worth. In that case, Kant’s refusal to allow any place in moral goodness for the emotions does not result from his basic principles, but from an assumption about the emotions that we can abandon without rejecting all the rest of his position. If we believe emotions are adaptable, we have good reason, from a Kantian point of view, to require morally good people to do what they can to adapt their emotions to the good will. The difference between the Kantian and the Aristotelian view is not a basic difference between two attitudes to moral goodness.¹⁸  
- We would be entitled to mark a sharp contrast between Aristotle and Kant on the place of the emotions in moral virtue if each accepted an extreme claim, so that (i) Kant believed that emotions have no part in virtue, and (ii) Aristotle believed that virtue requires the right emotions, even when they are not up to us. Neither Kant nor Aristotle, however, accepts the extreme claim; acceptance of it would cause serious difficulties for the rest of their positions. A reasonable assumption about the adaptability of emotions reconciles the Kantian and the Aristotelian positions. 
- Some people act steadily and scrupulously, and to this extent conscientiously, but on deplorable principles. Some of them might have some trace of decency left in their emotional reactions, if (for instance) they cannot help feeling some revulsion at the cruelty that they regard as morally required. Does Kant give such people the wrong advice?²² To see where Kant stands on this question, we need to divide it into two questions:
    - about objective rightness - In Aquinas’ terms, the first is about what makes the will good and conscience correct. Aquinas answers that the goodness of the will depends on the object willed (ST 1–2 q19 a2). Kant’s answers to the first question are sometimes over-simplified, since he sometimes suggests it is easy to apply the categorical imperative. His formulations of the categorical imperative show that his theory conflicts with his simple answer. Though the principle of morality is accessible to all rational agents without any special empirical knowledge or non-rational reactions, recognition of the action that correctly applies the principle in particular cases may not be equally easy. When Kant sets out different principles in the Doctrine of Virtue, he appends ‘casuistical questions’ that illustrate some of the difficulties that arise in applying these principles to specific cases. Though he is notorious for his rigid prohibition of lying, he recognizes some cases where it is not easy to distinguish a ‘white lie’ or socially expected untruth from a morally significant lie.²⁴ The correct application of principles apparently relies on empirical knowledge and on well-trained emotions.  To find the action that actually promotes interests or meets needs, we may need some empirical information; morality may not require us to possess this information, but it requires us to do what can reasonably be expected of us to acquire it. Similarly, respect for rational agents may require consideration for their aims and their reactions; we may not know how to show such consideration if we do not understand them, and hence morality may require us to try to understand them. Kant is therefore right to raise casuistical questions. His formulation and explanation of the categorical imperative should lead us to expect them. 
    - about subjective rightness - the second is about whether an erring conscience binds. Aquinas answers that none the less an erring conscience binds (q19 a5); though the will is not good when it follows an erring conscience, it would be worse if it acted against the erring conscience (q19 a6). Kant need not claim that we ought to trust our rational judgment against our emotions in every case of perplexity, if our rational judgment has been formed simply by finding some answer to the question about universal law. His theory gives him no reason to suppose that everyone’s rational judgments are appropriately formed. If I do not consider any of the questions that ought to be asked in this situation in order to apply the categorical imperative, Kant gives me no special reason to trust the judgment that results from deliberation about what to do here and now; for this judgment may be hasty, superficial, or self-serving. In many cases, a rational judgment should recognize that (for instance) it is easy to deceive myself in cases like this one and I ought to pay some attention to my feelings of reluctance or revulsion. Kant does not imply that I ought always to follow my deliberative judgment, however I have formed it. But he is committed to a controversial claim about subjective rightness. If we have made a reasonable and honest effort to apply the categorical imperative, we are obliged, in Kant’s view, to act on the conclusion of our rational reflexion, even against our feelings of reluctance. The subjectively right action may conflict with the tendency of moral feeling and non-rational reactions that give us the objectively right answer in this particular case. Some critics might infer that Kant’s position on subjective rightness must be mistaken. But we ought not to be so easily convinced. Admittedly, the subjectively right answer, by Kant’s criterion, will sometimes be objectively wrong. But we have no more reliable alternative. We may also be misled if we trust our emotions in cases where they confilct with the results of our careful and considered deliberative efforts. In many such cases, reflective agents will be subjectively and objectively right to reject the tendency of their recalcitrant emotions. The mere fact that emotions sometimes lead to the objectively right action is not a good enough reason for trusting them. We can illustrate this point through one of the examples often used against Kant, the case of the ‘conscientious Nazi’ who overcomes his reluctance to kill innocent Jews because he believes it to be his duty.²⁵ This case offers a counter-example to Kant only if two conditions are satisfied: 
        - The Nazi’s conviction about his duty is the result of an honest and impartial examination of the source of the conviction. Let us suppose (contrary to historical fact) that the Nazi satisfies the first condition. 
        - He has good reason, which he ought to have seen, to trust his reluctance. He still might not satisfy the second condition:
            - If he reasonably believes that he is reluctant only because he cannot stand the sight of blood, he might recall that he was right to overcome this reluctance in order to help injured people to safety; hence he might reasonably conclude that his reluctance is irrational, and should not persuade him to act against his presumed conscientious convictions. The mere fact that his squeamishness at the sight of blood would lead to the objectively right action in this case does not show that he would have been subjectively right to follow it. 
            - If, on the contrary, he would have been subjectively right to follow his emotion, it is difficult to see a sharp conflict with following one’s conscience. For any justification we might give for following the recalcitrant emotions would have to say why they are likely to be reliable in certain cases; but any such likelihood is already considered by a reflective rational agent forming a rational judgment. If the ‘conscientious Nazi’ has failed to consider his reasons for trusting his emotional reactions, he fails to meet the first condition mentioned above; for his judgment does not rest on honest and impartial examination. Hence he is not really ‘conscientious’ in the way that would create a counter-example to Kant. Kant believes, therefore, as Aquinas does, that an erring conscience binds; but an erring conscience is different from hasty, careless, or self-serving moral judgment. We ought not to ignore aspects of moral judgment that depend on emotions, non-rational reactions, and grasp of specifci features of particular situations. Kant exaggerates the ease, simplicity, and purely procedural character of moral judgments. But his theory not only allows, but actually requires, attention to the non-rational aspects of moral judgment. 
- We need not, therefore, reject Kant’s arguments against sentimentalism in order to reach a fair estimate of the place of non-rational motives in moral worth and character. We may reasonably accept his views about the rational character of the moral motive and the nature of moral reasons, while still maintaining that in a morally good person the rational motives moving us to act from duty should be supported by appropriate non-rational motives. The most plausible version of Kant’s position requires a good person to integrate the moral motive with the other motives and tendencies that form a character. 
- To see whether Kant has a good case against rationalism, we may consider his attitude to intuitionism and pluralism. 
- Does he believe that moral imperatives rest on fundamental intuitions? His argument does not simply try to uncover a series of fundamental moral principles that the good will simply accepts without further defence or explanation. He does not suggest that fundamental principles express ‘fitnesses’ that are intrinsically necessary, in the way that mathematical truths are, according to Clarke. In general, Kant is hostile to appeals to self-evidence; he objects that the mere claim of self-evidence does not allow us to discriminate between mutually contradictory claimants to this title. This objection seems especially pertinent to allegedly self-evident moral principles that are in fact often contested.²⁷ In contrast to intuitionist appeals to self-evidence, Kant argues that categorical imperatives are true and necessary because of their relation to rational agency, not because of some intrinsic necessity. Kant does not complete this argument against rationalist intuitionism in his exposition of the categorical imperative as the supreme principle of morality. But if he can complete it, he may avoid appeal to intuitions:
    - For if we can show that a principle relies on reasons that apply to rational agents as such, we connect moral principles with principles of rational agency. If these principles are intuitively known and prior to moral principles, Kant is an intuitionist not about moral principles, but about principles of rational agency. 
    - If principles of rational agency are not intuitively known, but are prior to moral principles, and rely on some inferential justification, Kant is not an intuitionist about practical principles, but a holist. 
    - If neither moral principles nor rational principles are prior, but they are known through each other, Kant is still a holist, though the circle of justification is smaller. 
- Since Kant opposes intuitionism about moral principles, he believes that if he cannot connect morality to freedom and rational agency in ways that vindicate his claims about categorical imperatives, the only alternative is scepticism or nihilism about morality. But we may not be inclined to draw this drastic conclusion. Even if we cannot defend moral principles by appeal to distinct principles of reason, why should they not stand on their own feet without external support? We might concede to Kant that morality would be in a rationally stronger position if its principles could be shown to be principles of practical reason, but we might still treat intuitionism as a second-best that is preferable to scepticism or nihilism.²⁸ We might give a different account of how moral principles could ‘stand on their own feet’ without appeal to a strong version of intuitionism. In arguing for his account of the moral motive and the supreme principle of morality, Kant proceeds:
    1) first ‘from common rational to philosophic moral cognition' - He proceeds from refelxion on examples in common moral judgment to discover the relevant general principles. He argues that in our advance towards the metaphysics of morals, we should not rely wholly on examples, but should look for the general principles, even if we cannot at once embody them in clear examples.³¹ If we succeed in this task, we give a systematic account of the principles underlying common moral judgments. Why not claim that success in this task gives us an inferential justification for the principles that we have reached? If we are right to claim this, we avoid intuitionism about the principles, provided that the moral judgments we begin with are initially credible. This is a description of the ‘analytic’ or ‘regressive’ method that Kant follows in the Groundwork. He does not believe it is completely satisfactory. His regressive analysis of morality opposes sentimentalism, and, as far as it goes, agrees with rationalism. His disagreements with rationalism depend on doctrines that he does not defend in his regressive analysis. The comparison with rationalist intuitionism draws our attention to questions about both the foundations and the applications of Kant’s account of morality. Until we examine these aspects of his position, we may suspend judgment about how far he avoids intuitionism. 
    2) ‘from popular moral philosophy to metaphysics of morals’.In the Second Critique, he follows a ‘synthetic’ or ‘progressive’ method that begins from the higher principles and derives the lower from them. One might suppose that this method commits him to intuitionism. Aristotle contrasts argument from what is better-known ‘to us’, leading us to the principles, and argument from what is better-known ‘by nature’. He sometimes uses this contrast to distinguish dialectical argument, starting from common beliefs, and demonstrative argument, proceeding from principles that ultimately rest on self-evident principles.³² If Kant follows this aspect of Aristotle, his progressive method relies on intuitionist foundationalism. But he avoids appeals to intuition of moral first principles if he relies on principles about practical reason. These are not grasped by intuition, if they are principles presupposed by acknowledged facts about practical reason. In that case, Kant’s progressive method relies on some appeal outside morality to practical reason. Whether it relies on intuitionism about principles of practical reason depends on the status he assigns to these principles. These reflexions suggest why Kant seeks to avoid intuitionism, and why, none the less, an intuitionist might be willing to co-opt part of Kant’s argument. At any rate, we might reasonably doubt whether claims to moral knowledge would be as groundless as Kant thinks they would be if his progressive argument failed. 
- It is even less clear whether Kant is justified in his rejection of intuitionist pluralism about moral principles. One might suppose that his argument reduces the various fundamental intuitions of Clarke and Price to the single principle of the categorical imperative in its various formulations. But even if the Formula of Humanity expresses the categorical imperative of morality, and it has some practical content, it does not seem to offer us a supreme principle parallel to the utilitarian principle. If the utilitarian principle is right, we do not need ‘heads of virtue’ without any rule of priority. But if Kant is right, we do not yet know that treating persons as ends will replace heads of virtue that may conflict. One might argue that some aspects of intrinsic concern for rational beings require impartial benevolence, others require impartial justice, and still others require special ties to particular individuals. If we do not know that treatment of persons as ends gives priority to one of these heads of virtue rather than the others, we retain Price’s pluralism.
- Kant and the rationalist intuitionists seem to share one important presupposition in their approach to morality. Butler and Price object to utilitarianism and support pluralism by mentioning actions that would be wrong even if they maximized utility. When Kant formulates the supreme principle of morality, he represents it as a law that tells us how to act. They seem to agree, therefore, in a law-based, action-directed approach to morality. The appeal to law and the orientation towards action seem to explain each other. If we think of laws and imperatives, we think of commands to act; and if we are looking for a morality that guides action, we look for rules or principles that tell us what to do. This law-based and action-oriented outlook is often taken to be characteristic of modern as opposed to ancient moral outlooks.³³ We have already found good reasons, however, to question any sharp contrast between a ‘virtue-based’ and a ‘law-based’ conception of morality, especially if this contrast is identifeid with the contrast between orientation towards states of character and orientation towards actions. Reflexion on Aquinas shows us especially clearly how an account of natural law may support an account of morality that is fundamentally about the virtues; the ‘action’ required by the highest principles of natural law is the formation of one’s outlook and character through the different virtues. Aquinas does not intend his introduction of natural law to shift the emphasis of his moral theory from virtues to actions or from the internal to the external.³⁶ We need not assume, therefore, that Kant is different from Aquinas on this point. We need to look more closely to see whether his emphasis on laws and imperatives is intended to relegate character and virtue to a secondary place.
- The virtues are important, in Aquinas’ view, partly because they integrate the passions with the will. Kant does not entirely share this view, because he sometimes doubts whether the passions are voluntary.³⁷ If we discount these doubts, questions still remain about the role of the virtues: 
    - Does Kant agree with those who emphasize the virtues because they take states of a person to be non-instrumentally valuable, and not simply valuable for the results that they produce? This is Aristotle’s and Aquinas’ view about the virtues, in contrast to Hume’s. 
    - Does he agree with those who take virtues to be necessary even for right action, because the range of right actions cannot be completely specified without appeal to the judgment of the virtuous person? 
- Some answer the first question by claiming that Kant’s theory is action-centred and rule-centred, whereas an Aristotelian theory is person-centred.³⁸ If this claim means that Kant’s concern with goodness of persons is only secondary to, or derived from, his concern with the rightness of actions and of rules guiding actions, the claim is false. For Kant begins the Groundwork with an inquiry into the good will, and he continues by trying to describe the motives and principles that define a good will. Similarly, in the Second Critique, he seeks to distinguish the free and autonomous will from the heteronomous will. The view that Kant is primarily concerned with actions and rules assumes that the categorical imperative, in its Formula of Universal Law, is meant to provide an effective method for identifying a right action. This view of the formula can claim support from some of Kant’s remarks, but it does not fit most of them. He does not take the main aim of a moral theory to be the identification of right actions; he tries to find the good will. 
- A further contrast between Aristotle and Kant rests on the view that Aristotle is a ‘virtue theorist’, not only in the obvious sense that he attaches moral importance to virtues and not simply to actions, but in the narrower sense that he assigns some metaphysical or epistemological or explanatory priority to virtues over actions. One might express this claim about priority by saying that an action is virtuous because it is the action a virtuous person would do, and the converse is not true.³⁹ If this is what it takes to be a virtue theorist, neither Kant nor Aristotle nor Aquinas is a virtue theorist. To describe the actions characteristic of the different virtues, Aristotle refers to the human good; he does not suggest that, for instance, facing danger for the sake of a good cause is brave simply because it is what a brave person would choose. On the contrary, the brave person chooses this sort of action because it promotes the common good of his community. Similarly, Aquinas believes that the natural law prescribes the actions belonging to all the virtues; conformity to the natural law, which in turn prescribes the pursuit of the human good, makes them virtuous actions. Kant’s failure to be a virtue theorist (in the sense just described) does not distinguish him from the most prominent moralists who have given a central place to the virtues. 
- To see the place that Kant finds for virtue and the virtues, we may begin with his introduction of different types of duties. In offering examples of the application of the formulae of the categorical imperative, he divides duties into (Virtue enters the discussion because of the specific role of ends in virtues. In the Second Critique (ch. 2), Kant argues that practical reason aims at a certain kind of end, though he insists that this end is not prior to the moral law. In the Doctrine of Virtue, he appeals to this feature of practical reason to distinguish principles of law (or ‘right’, Recht) from principles of virtue (Tugend). It is not so clear how he distinguishes them, since he seems to rely on a number of non-equivalent contrasts. If we survey these contrasts, we may be able to clarify his conception of virtue):
    - Duties to oneself/others:
        - those owed to oneself 
        - those owed to others 
    - Perfect/Imperfect Duties (This latter division, discussed more fully in the Metaphysics of Morals, underlies the division between the spheres of law and of virtue. ):
        - ‘perfect’ 
        - ‘imperfect’
- The doctrine of law prescribes certain actions that the state must compel citizens to do if the state is to follow the prescriptions of the categorical imperative. These actions are required so that the freedom of each agent can co-exist with the freedom of every other agent according to a universal law (MdS 381). The state enforces only what is ‘possible’. By ‘possible’, Kant usually seems to mean ‘physically possible’. He suggests, for instance (218), that while the state can compel me to act, it cannot compel me to act from a certain motive. This point does not show why the state should not encourage me to act from a certain motive, since encouragement is physically possible. Kant gives a different reason to show why the use of compulsion to produce virtue is not possible (382); being virtuous depends on the free choice of a maxim and an end, in some sense that excludes external compulsion. Here the impossibility seems to be logical. Kant seems to mean that no one can compel me to change my motives freely. 
- Sometimes the law prescribes actions and the virtuous will does the very same actions from the right motive—because they are morally required and not because they are legally prescribed. Someone might conform to the law for fear of punishment or because it is good for business.⁴⁰ The virtuous person, however, accepts the moral duties imposed by law because they are moral duties. She would not steal her neighbour’s property (an action forbidden by law) even if she could steal it with impunity and no one would fnid out. 
- In these cases, principles of virtue prescribe distinctively virtuous ‘actions’ that include a reference to the ‘interests’ underlying them. Since the law prescribes actions without reference to the agent’s intention, these actions do not fall under the prescriptions of law. Kant speaks of ‘inner legislation’, which may not prescribe different behaviour, but demands ‘actions’ that include an appropriate motive:⁴¹ Virtuous people differ from those who merely conform to the moral law, because they take a different attitude to the same behaviour. But virtuous people also aim at ends that go beyond the moral demands of law. Since they accept the categorical imperative as their principle, they acknowledge ends that are also duties. Acceptance of the moral law for its own sake requires the acceptance of ethical ends; there could not even be a categorical imperative unless there were objective ends (MdS 384).⁴² Recognition of an objective end is the basis for the virtuous person’s fulfilment of duties of law as well as duties of virtue; but only specifci duties of virtue correspond to specifci obligatory ends.⁴³ The obligatory ends aim at our own perfection and the happiness of others. We form these ends if we accept the categorical imperative, and so treat rational beings as ends. We might wonder why we should not aim at the happiness and perfection of rational beings impartially, but Kant argues (MdS 385) that we cannot treat our own happiness or the perfection of others as obligatory ends. He claims that I cannot take my own happiness as an obligatory end, because I aim at it anyhow. But he also admits that I may not always aim at my happiness, and that I may care more about it at some times than at other times (G 399). In that case—even if we accept Kant’s views about the conditions for obligation⁴⁴—he should allow that I am obliged to care about my happiness to the appropriate degree on the appropriate occasions. 
- In some cases, Kant believes that virtue prescribes actions that are not prescribed by the moral law to the non-virtuous person. But virtue does not add more duties of the same kind to duties of law. It prescribes ‘duties of wide obligation’, whereas law prescribes duties of narrow obligation (389). The law enjoins respect for other people’s property and lives without exception. It does not allow me to choose to leave one person alive rather than another, but it requires all the actions of the relevant type. Virtue, however, allows us some freedom to choose which of the actions that fall under a rule we will do.⁴⁵ In enjoining charity, virtue does not require me to do every possible act of charity that might be open to me. Virtue prescribes an appropriate maxim (391) and an appropriate end to aim at, but it does not necessarily prescribe a given particular action that falls under the maxim. It therefore does not specify any defniitely required actions that could be enjoined rigorously by the law. 
- So far we have found three divisions between law and virtue: 
    - Law prescribes actions that we ‘can’ be compelled to perform, but virtue prescribes actions that cannot be compelled. 
    - Law prescribes actions only, but virtue also prescribes motives and ends. 
    - Law prescribes duties of narrow obligation, but virtue prescribes duties of wide obligation. 
    - Law prescribes what is simply required, but virtue prescribes what is supererogatory or meritorious. Hence failure to follow the prescriptions of virtue is proof not of demerit (a minus quantity), but only of lack of merit (zero), ‘unless the agent makes it his principle not to submit to these duties’ (389). It is difficult to see how Kant takes these four divisions between law and virtue to be connected. It is not obvious that they coincide. The connexion of the fourth division with the other three is especially obscure. Kant may suggest that since virtue prescribes duties of wide obligation, it is more meritorious to fulfil a duty of virtue than to fulfil a duty of law. But if he means this, his view is open to question. For it is no more difficult or praiseworthy to do some small act of charity than to fulfil one’s obligation to serve in the armed forces in wartime. 
- Nor do the first and third divisions coincide. If duties of virtue are duties of wide obligation, perhaps law cannot compel us to perform any particular action prescribed by virtue.⁴⁶ But it can still compel us disjunctively. A law might compel us to give at least 1 per cent of our income to at least one of the charities on a list of registered charities; such compulsion would be neither logically nor physically impossible. Though Kant is right to distinguish observance of law from virtue, he is not so clearly right to suggest (if indeed he means to suggest) that they always involve duties of different types.⁴⁷ Leibniz’s view of justice as the charity of the wise may therefore be preferable to Kant’s separation of justice from charity.
- While each of Kant’s divisions might be legitimate for different purposes, the one that is most relevant for separating conformity to law from virtue is the one that relies on an appropriate end. A virtue essentially involves specific states of character and motivation that are not simply tendencies to specifci sorts of action. The notion of an obligatory end captures the central features of a virtue, as the Aristotelian outlook conceives it: (1) It includes one’s aiming at a certain end and acting for the sake of the end, not simply a tendency to act a specific way. (2) Aristotle identifies the end of virtuous action with the fine, which he also identifies with the right (deon); he seeks to distinguish it from other goods that one might aim at as non-instrumental ends.⁴⁸ Kant captures this feature of the fine and the right, by saying that the end aimed at by the virtuous person is the one that we have a duty to aim at. 
- Kant’s objections to naturalism rest on contestable assumptions (These are features of the conception of human nature that underlies the ethical theories of Hobbes, Hutcheson, and Hume.): 
    - Naturalism takes facts about nature to be prior to facts about morality, and takes the truth of moral principles to depend on their correspondence to prior truths about nature. Kant believes that moral principles are fundamental in a way that is obscured by naturalism. 
    - Facts about nature are facts about actual human beings as they are; they are empirical facts unsuitable for the support of moral principles. An appeal to human nature introduces an empirical element into the grounds of moral obligation. If these grounds are empirical, they lie in circumstances that do not belong to the rational will as such. Hence an appeal to human nature cannot acknowledge that grounds of moral obligation belong essentially to the rational will.⁵⁰ 
    - Facts about nature are facts about what human beings actually want and how they react, and so they make the truth of moral principles depend on facts about human desires and sentiments. One might argue that Aquinas’ frist principle of natural law exposes him to Kant’s objections. When Aquinas claims that we necessarily pursue a fnial good, to be identifeid with happiness, he might appear to appeal to empirical features, as Kant understands them, of human beings. Though Kant agrees that all human beings pursue happiness,⁵¹ he believes that this sort of universality makes happiness a source of merely empirical principles, and hence a source of heteronomous willing. A rational will that treats happiness as its frist principle derives its law from something external, and therefore does not act autonomously.⁵² This objection overlooks Aquinas’ view that one’s ultimate good one is not an empirical end.⁵³ The first principle of natural law prescribes the pursuit of good and the avoidance of evil, because rational agents necessarily pursue their ultimate good. Aquinas does not refer to empirical peculiarities of human mental states. On the contrary, he describes essential properties of rational agents. A rational human will observes the natural law not because of some empirical feature of human agents, but simply because of its rational agency. This form of naturalism, therefore, does not make moral principles inappropriately empirical or inappropriately dependent on actual desires and sentiments.⁵⁴ It is harder to say whether Aquinas’ naturalism makes the relevant facts about human nature prior to moral facts, and whether such a claim about priority would be mistaken. He introduces the ultimate end, identified with happiness, without explicit reference to morality; we are expected to recognize that rational agents pursue happiness as their ultimate end even before we agree that they have good reason to follow moral principles. To this extent happiness is theoretically prior to morality. But what is wrong with that sort of theoretical priority? We might well sympathize with Kant’s objections to a theory that fixed the content of happiness independently of morality and then relegated morality to the status of an instrumental means to happiness. But neither Aristotle nor Aquinas accepts a theory of that sort.⁵⁵ 
- To see whether Kant offers a further defence of these two claims about morality, we need to examine his claims about freedom. He claims that the reality of freedom is necessarily connected with the reality of the moral law; but the nature of the connexion is not always clear. We know freedom through our awareness of the moral law, and if we were not aware of the moral law, we would not be entitled to assume that we are free; hence the moral law is our way of knowing (ratio cognoscendi) freedom. But the reality of the moral law (its ratio essendi) consists in freedom; we are obliged by the moral law because we are free.¹ This division between the ratio cognoscendi and the ratio essendi allows the ratio essendi to be relevant to knowledge and justification. Kant’s division corresponds to his two methods of argument, regressive and progressive. The regressive argument proceeding through our moral convictions leads us to the conviction that we are free. The progressive argument, beginning from our freedom, justifies us in believing that there is a categorical imperative, and hence that there are true moral principles.² That is why Kant suggests that the belief in freedom plays some justifying role. In the Groundwork, he observes that, even if common moral beliefs presuppose a categorical imperative, there may be no such thing. To vindicate belief in a categorical imperative, we must also have good reason to believe that we are free. Once we recognize we are free, we will see that we have reason to follow the moral law, and so we will recognize it as a categorical imperative. If the progressive argument gives us the ratio essendi, it begins from a principle that is better-known ‘by nature’, because it gives the true explanation of the purported facts about morality that we recognize in our moral convictions. Hence Kant should show us that claims about freedom rest on some basis that is distinct from the moral convictions we begin from, and that shows how those moral convictions are correct. 
- Some of Kant’s remarks, however, may appear to deny this justificatory role of freedom. He asserts that our consciousness of the moral law is a basic ‘fact of reason’.³ We have no independent access to freedom apart from our moral convictions, nor can we fnid a deduction of the moral law parallel to the deduction of the categories.⁴ On the contrary, the moral law has to serve as a ‘principle of the deduction of freedom’ (48). Whereas the moral law itself needs no justification, it proves the reality of freedom.⁵ Do these claims mean that we cannot hope to defend our moral convictions by appeal to anything further? If so, Kant seems to agree with rationalist intuitionism on one basic question. But if this is his view, why is he so reserved about the arguments in the first two chapters of the Groundwork? He warns us that they do not show that there is a categorical imperative, but only what it would have to be like if there is one? Does the Second Critique abandon that reservation? One might argue that the further argument one needs to support our awareness of the moral law is simply an argument to show that freedom is possible, in so far as it does not contradict our other reasonable beliefs about the world. Kant believes that we need to go far enough into metaphysics to settle this question about possibility. But if that is all we can settle, it seems a weak basis for asserting that there is a categorical imperative. For even if we are free, we still need some argument to show that we must recognize reasons that apply to all rational agents as such. To see what the fact of reason does and does not settle, we need to say more precisely what the fact is. Two possibilities are these: 
    - A weaker fact: we are aware of principles that present themselves as categorical imperatives. he weaker fact presents a plausible claim about what we have discovered in the regressive argument. If Kant has succeeded in this argument, he has shown that our moral convictions represent moral principles as categorical imperatives; but it is a further question whether our moral convictions are right in representing them this way. In the Groundwork, Kant recognizes this further question. If the fact of reason that Kant has in mind is the weaker fact, his remarks in the Second Critique do not rule out an examination of the further question. Since Kant does not commit himself to affirming the stronger fact as a fact of reason needing no further defence, we may reasonably suppose that he affrims only the weaker fact, and see whether he has an argument to answer the further question that arises from the weaker fact. 
    - A stronger fact: we are subject to a categorical imperative of morality. If, however, the relevant fact is the stronger fact, Kant does not leave room for a further question about whether the moral law really is a categorical imperative.
- We can now sketch the argument that Kant may reasonably intend: 
    1) We are conscious of a moral law. If we are right to suppose that the fact of reason that Kant has in mind is the weaker fact, he maintains only (1) at the outset. 
    2) If we are conscious of a moral law, we are free. We need metaphysics to show that freedom is possible, so that we can affrim, on the basis of (1) and (2), that we are free, without any contradiction between theoretical and practical reason. 
    3) We are free. 
    4) If we are free, we have reason to recognize the moral law as a categorical imperative. But if we accept (3), we still leave (4) open. The weaker fact of reason that Kant recognizes (in (1)) does not answer every question about justification. An answer to (4) might settle a question that rationalist intuitionism leaves unanswered. We may be convinced that we have rational certainty about some basic moral principles; but why should we trust that conviction? The rationalist answer that we have no choice may be true, but it does not tell us what is rational about our trust in moral convictions.⁶ 
- But if we agree with his claim that the free will as such acts on practical laws, we need not yet agree that practical laws include moral laws. We need an argument from freedom first to practical law, but then to moral law. These questions show us that Kant’s fact of reason neither answers nor excludes further questions of justification. He claims only that we are aware of moral principles that claim to be categorical imperatives; he does not yet claim that we know that this claim is correct. It is worth our while to ask whether he gives further reasons, proceeding from principles about free agency, to believe in moral categorical imperatives. To see what sort of argument Kant can offer, we should set out from the weaker fact of reason, that we are aware of principles that present themselves as categorical imperatives. We can then ask whether this awareness of ostensible categorical imperatives reveals freedom to us. This question should be clearer if we consider the different types of freedom that he might have in mind; for different types of freedom might have different roles in an account of morality. Kant’s claims about freedom lead him into some controversial metaphysical claims. In his view, freedom and morality require acceptance of his version of indeterminism about free will, relying on his division between the phenomenal and the noumenal world. In his view, the moral will is the noumenal will, operating outside ordinary empirically observable causal relations. We need to consider the relevance of these metaphysical views about freedom and determinism to Kant’s moral theory. 
- For the purposes of this argument, I need not believe that the moral law actually presents me with a categorical imperative. Nor need I agree that it is ever rational to try to change my strongest occurrent desire by reflexion. Kant claims only that I recognize a capacity to modify my strongest desire. He relies, therefore, only on the weak fact of reason. 
- he capacity that is revealed by the claims of morality is the type of freedom that Kant calls ‘practical’ freedom, the will’s independence of necessitation by ‘sensuous’ or ‘empirical’ impulses. This practical freedom distinguishes the rational will from the purely animal will (arbitrium brutum, MdS 212; KrV A534/B562).¹¹ In the animal will, choice and action result from the strongest desire, but in the free will, rational reflexion affects my choice apart from the initial strength of my desires. This conception of practical freedom agrees with Butler’s and Reid’s conception of rational agency. The rational agent is not determined simply by the ‘animal strength’ (as Reid calls it) of impulses, but is capable of acting on considerations of comparative value.¹² 
- Kant compares practical reason with theoretical understanding. They are similar in so far as they are both rational capacities, to be contrasted with the senses (in the theoretical case) and with sensory impulses (in the practical case). They are different in so far as one is concerned with rational prediction of the world and the other with rationally changing the world. This normative order is expressed by the practical use of ‘ought’. We do not simply report or register events. In our judgments about what ought to be done, we express our view about how it would be reasonable for things to be
- In appealing to practical freedom to mark a division between the free will (arbitrium) and the animal will, Kant follows Aquinas’ division between will (voluntas) and passion. Aquinas believesthatwehavefreewill(liberumarbitrium)becausewehaveawill(voluntas)—rational desire that is formed by response to reasons, not on the strength of passions, and is therefore not coerced by sensory impulses. Kant agrees with this connexion between freedom and rational will. According to Kant, practical freedom requires not only internal causation, but also rational causation. Aquinas’ conception of the will and free choice expresses this demand for rational causation. Aquinas’ position, however, allows practical freedom to co-exist with causal determinism. If Kant agreed on this point, he could assert practical freedom without taking any particular position on the truth of determinism. Since Kant believes he has compelling theoretical reasonstoacceptdeterminismforappearances—thesubject-matterofscientifcitheories—he has a good reason to welcome a compatibilist account of freedom. 
- Sometimes Kant elaborates his view of freedom by distinguishing the will as the power of election, the Willku¨r (arbitrium), from the will as rational will, the Wille (voluntas).¹⁵ The elective will and the rational will are the same appetitive power,¹⁶ but they have different properties. The Wille is neither free nor unfree (MdS 226), whereas the Willku¨r is free, by not being necessitated by sensuous impulses. The Willku¨r initiates action, and is the source of maxims that guide action, whereas the Wille is the source of practical laws. This division may be clarified through Aquinas’ discussion of freewill and rational will. When we act freely, we act on our will, but the will is not related in the same way to all free actions. Though the will is never necessitated by the passions, it may be influenced by them, so that our deliberation is affected by the apparent goods presented by the passions. In such cases, we act on our election or on consent by the will, but the will is not self-determining in the same way as when it deliberates without the influence of the passions. This is Kant’s view of the relation between Wille and Willku¨r. When we act freely, we act on a maxim that is accepted by the Wille. But the Wille may accept a maxim for different reasons; it either acts on its own initiative or accepts the suggestions of sensuous impulses. These different attitudes of the Wille determine the character of the Willku¨r, which determines our action. Whatever attitude the Wille takes, we act freely; and this is the freedom that is revealed by our awareness of the moral law. 
- The different attitudes of the rational will towards the suggestions of sensuous impulses underlie the two different types of freedom that Kant calls ‘negative’ and ‘positive’. We are negatively free in so far as nothing coerces the Willku¨r; we are positively free in so far as we are determined by the legislation of the Wille giving itself the law.¹⁷ Negative freedom is the freedom of responsibility, but positive freedom is the freedom of the good will. When we are negatively but not positively free, our Wille is heteronomous, and so is the resulting Willku¨r.¹⁸ When we are positively free, we are autonomous; ‘autonomy of the Wille is that property of it, by which it is to itself (independently of any property of objects of volition) a law’ (G 440). Heteronomy results if the Wille ‘goes outside itself and seeks the law in the property of any of its objects’ (441). In this case, ‘the Wille does not give itself the law, but the object through its relation to the Wille gives the law to it’. 
- The contrast between heteronomy and autonomy supports Kant’s criticism of mistaken moral theories and of mistaken moral attitudes.¹⁹ If non-Kantian theories about practical reason were correct, our willing would be necessarily heteronomous, since these theories claim that practical reason can only find ways to fulfil some aim given to it from outside. These theories do not recognize the possibility of autonomy. We can adopt a heteronomous outlook by restricting our practical reason to the subordinate role that, according to mistaken moral theories, is its only possible role. The theories are mistaken because they do not recognize that even heteronomous agents are capable of autonomy, and hence not necessarily heteronomous. 
- The division between negative and positive freedom helps Kant to avoid a misunderstanding that might result from his tendency to identify morality with freedom. Since he believes that acting on the moral law results from motivation by reason rather than by sensuous impulses, we might infer that if we are motivated by sensuous impulses contrary to reason, we are not free but compelled; in that case, our desires or urges are ‘overwhelming’ or ‘uncontrollable’. When Kant says that heteronomy involves the dependence of the rational will on sensuous impulses, so that it gives only hypothetical imperatives, we might infer that the rational will is overcome and subjected. But he rejects this inference. The acceptance of an evil maxim results from the exercise of free will. Heteronomous agents have negative freedom, the freedom of responsibility. Their rational will is not compelled to accept maxims that have some other source than the rational will itself, and even when it has accepted them, it is still capable of giving itself the law. Hence, our permanent negative freedom is a permanent capacity for autonomy. The difference between heteronomy and autonomy does not consist in the difference between compulsion and free acceptance, but in the source of the principles that we freely accept. 
- We become evil, therefore, not by being overcome by an evil principle, but by freely incorporating such a principle in our maxim.²⁰ Hence an evil disposition ‘must have been adopted by free choice (Willku¨r)’ (Rel. 25). Evil does not belong to a person’s sensuous non-rational nature (Rel. 35).We become evil only because we accept the demands of this non-rational nature and incorporate them into our maxim as the overriding principle.²
- Kant suggests (Rel. 36) that if we had no sensuous impulses, the will would accept the moral law, but since we have these impulses, we have a potential rival to the guidance of the moral law. Why do we choose one guide rather than the other?     
- Kant may seem to have no acceptable solution. Our mistaken choice, incorporating the satisfaction of sensuous impulses in our maxim as the overriding aim, cannot simply result from non-rational compulsion. But if it is an action of the rational will, why are we any less positively free by following sensuous impulses than by accepting the moral law? We can see how we are positively free, to the extent that we exercise our capacity to choose between maxims. But if the choice of evil is a rational choice by the rational will, why does the rational will not give itself the law in choosing evil? Positive freedom seems to have no special connexion with morality. This difficulty for Kant is similar to the one that Aristotle and Aquinas face in trying to do justice to the rationality of vice. They believe that the vicious person is not overcome by passion; he elects his perverse end, and so reaches it by some sort of deliberation about the final good.²² The virtuous person reaches his correct end by deliberation about the fnial good. How, then, can the virtuous person be guided by reason in some way that distinguishes him from the vicious person? Aristotelian deliberation raises the difficulties that arise for Kantian incorporation into a maxim; in both cases, we find it hard to maintain a special connexion between moral virtue and guidance by practical reason. 
- We may understand the Aristotelian and Kantian position better if we recognize that sometimes it is open to us to criticize or to evaluate our inclinations, but we decide not to bother. Often this is sensible; we might, for instance, be trying to choose between two films that we might go to, and we might conceive some aversion to one of them (perhaps the title or subject sounds unappealing, even though we have read favourable reviews). In such a case we could deliberate more fully, but it might be a waste of time. Sometimes, however, it is appropriate to examine our initial impulses and aversions. If we do not like stepping on cracks in the footpath, that may be a harmless aversion; but if we cannot bear the thought of travelling by air, that may be a severe handicap, and perhaps we ought to try to overcome it. According to Kant, we are guided by an evil maxim in cases where we realize that we could subject some end to further rational scrutiny, but we decide it is not worth our while. We exercise practical reason to some extent, in choosing between some inclinations; but we do not exercise it on ultimate ends. We do not recognize, until we think about it, that practical reason has any function at this level. If we believe that reason does not support any ultimate end over any other, we recognize no rational ground for incorporating the moral law into our maxim. According to this view about ends, some people favour morality without a further rational ground and others do not. We come to understand the falsity of this view once we see that we can make the rational choices that would not be open to us if ends were a matter of mere inclination. 
- Kant accepts the Aristotelian view that vicious people act on the assumption that something like Hume’s account of the capacity of practical reason is true. They see the possibility of attempting non-instrumental practical reasoning, but they think the attempt is futile, since they see no prospect of answering questions about ends by practical reason. InKant’sview, autonomy ispeculiartothewill that isguidedby thecategorical imperative. All other accounts of moral principles imply that heteronomy of choice is inevitable, rather than a misuse of the rational will.²³ Since we are all capable of autonomy, and hence of being guided by practical reason independently of ‘pathological law’, we are capable of autonomy even when we act heteronomously. Even in heteronomous agents the rational will is not determined by empirical impulses in a way that prevents choice about whether or not to act on them. 
- Kant’s example of the fear of death recalls Butler’s argument to demonstrate the absurdity of supposing that we do not act on superior principles.²⁴ It illustrates Butler’s distinction between power and authority, which Reid calls ‘animal strength’ and ‘rational strength’
- From this it does not follow that we are capable of acting on categorical imperatives; for it may still turn out that there are no categorical imperatives. Even if we are capable of thinking about practical laws, we may be unable to act on them, because we may be unable to fnid any when we look for them. We may agree that we could get beyond a purely Humean outlook if we could fnid external reasons that apply to rational agents as such; but unless we can find some such reasons, we cannot act on them. 
- Do Kant’s reflexions about freedom give us any reason to believe that there are external reasons? We may approach this question by asking whether Kant is right to claim that only the moral law reveals freedom to us. His claim brings us back to our previous discussion of practical laws and categorical imperatives. We found that Kant has a reasonable argument for practical laws that do not depend on inclination but apply to rational agents as such. But we found that he has no good reason to claim that only moral principles are practical laws and categorical imperatives. If we agree with Aquinas, Butler, and Reid, we will also believe in categorical imperatives of prudence. 
- This point bears on Kant’s claim that the moral law reveals freedom to us. His claim does not apply exclusively to morality. We have equally good reason to believe that rational self-love reveals freedom. Kant does not agree, because he treats the desire for happiness as a purely ‘pathological’ (i.e., sensuous, non-rational) desire that is similar to a Humean passion. But if we doubt his conception of self-love, we may apply his claim about the moral law and freedom more widely. The practical freedom revealed by morality is the capacity to be guided by practical reason that does not incorporate ends derived from inclination into its maxim. A will that is guided by practical reason in this way is guided by practical laws and categorical imperatives. That is why Kant claims that the autonomous will is the will guided by categorical imperatives. If categorical imperatives are not restricted to moral principles, prudence as well as morality reveals to us the possibility of autonomy. 
- Kant’s argument from morality, rather than prudence, to practical freedom is open to doubt. He relies on our ability to follow moral principles against inclinations. Butler and Reid argue that we are capable of acting on rational appreciation of our own good, contrary to our inclinations. In Kant’s view, Butler and Reid are mistaken, for the reasons that Hume gives. But if we reject their view of prudence, why should we accept Kant’s view of morality? The apparent ability that supports Kant’s distinction between moral reason and non-moral inclination is very similar to the apparent ability that supports Butler and Reid on power and authority. Butler relies on this apparent ability in order to explain his conception of a superior principle in general. If Kant disagrees with Butler and Reid, he seems to undermine his own position too. We have already pointed out that Kant’s agreement with Hume about prudence and with Butler about morality leaves him a less stable position than either Butler’s or Hume’s. The same is true of his claims about freedom. If Kant agreed with Aquinas and Butler about the range of practical reason, would he make his claims about morality easier or more difficult to defend? He would help his position, in so far as he would strengthen his case for practical laws. For Aquinas and Butler implicitly attribute the characteristics of autonomy and independence of inclination to prudential as well as to moral motivation. If Kant rejects prudential imperatives independent of inclination, he undermines his own claims about moral imperatives. 
- Moral agents may act on rational refelxion to different degrees. Why should they exercise this capacity rather than leaving it unexercised? Butler answers that action on rational self-love is natural, in so far as it expresses myself; for I am a whole person, not just a series of episodes and impulses. In acting on rational refelxion, I express myself as a person and a rational agent; and since that is what I essentially am, I thereby express myself. This argument supports Kant’s claim that we should actualize the capacity we have, as negatively free agents, to act on reason rather than strength of impulses. In actualizing this capacity, we achieve positive freedom. Positive freedom and autonomy, so understood, admit of degrees. I have some degree of positive freedom in so far as I decide to resist, say, anger or frustration, in the light of the other ends I accept (if, for instance, my anger will damage my prospects with someone I want to impress or conciliate). Butler recognizes this feature of positive freedom; we are ‘a law unto ourselves’ by having and acting on a superior rational principle that regulates our particular passions.²⁵ But Kant recognizes that such a degree of autonomy may co-exist with a high degree of heteronomy. Even though I adjust particular passions to the rest of my ends, I may still take those particular ends to be outside rational deliberation and reflexion. In this case, my choice (Willku¨r) and the underlying will (Wille) are heteronomous, though I have not lost the capacity for autonomy. We are more autonomous if we apply rational deliberation and refelxion to the choice of ends that we pursue. Positive freedom and autonomy, so understood, admit of degrees. I have some degree of positive freedom in so far as I decide to resist, say, anger or frustration, in the light of the other ends I accept (if, for instance, my anger will damage my prospects with someone I want to impress or conciliate). Butler recognizes this feature of positive freedom; we are ‘a law unto ourselves’ by having and acting on a superior rational principle that regulates our particular passions.²⁵ But Kant recognizes that such a degree of autonomy may co-exist with a high degree of heteronomy. Even though I adjust particular passions to the rest of my ends, I may still take those particular ends to be outside rational deliberation and reflexion. In this case, my choice (Willku¨r) and the underlying will (Wille) are heteronomous, though I have not lost the capacity for autonomy. We are more autonomous if we apply rational deliberation and refelxion to the choice of ends that we pursue. they unrelated to the natural passion. Refelxion on the rationally appropriate object for my benevolent passions shows me that benevolence is appropriate in some cases where I have no antecedent passion. I may see, for instance, that it is arbitrary to distinguish cases where I help someone I already know from cases where I refuse to help someone in equal need just because I do not already know them. I adopt new ends, and do not merely discover new means to the ends I already had. Reid sees that the criticism and adoption of ends is a hallmark of practical reason.²⁶ 
- So far we have found a defence of Kant’s conception of autonomy, but no defence of his claim that autonomy requires morality. If we agree that we are capable of autonomy and of acting on categorical imperatives, why should we agree that if we fully realize this capacity, we act on moral imperatives? 
- In Kant’s view, the moral law reveals not only freedom, but also ‘personality’, something that ‘elevates a human being above himself as a part of the world of sense’ (KpV 86). Since personality is closely connected to freedom, we might find that the relation of morality to personality supports Kant’s claims about morality and freedom. Alternatively, we might fnid that the connexion between morality and personality offers a defence of the basis of morality that avoids the apparent weaknesses in his claims about freedom. Personality is important in Kant’s claims about the Formula of Humanity.²⁷ The right of persons to be treated as ends in themselves ‘rests on the personality of these beings, whereby alone they are ends in themselves’ (KpV 87). Personality is to be distinguished from mere ‘humanity’ (Rel. 26), because it ‘is rooted in reason which is practical of itself, that is, reason which dictates laws unconditionally’. This is why the origin of the sense of duty is personality.²⁸ The idea of personality awakens the respect that is appropriate for ends in themselves. Kant is justified in claiming that the moral law uniquely reveals personality, if personality implies the capacity to be moved by the moral law. When the Groundwork explains how personality makes people ends in themselves, it identifies personality not simply with the capacity to be moved by the moral law, but, more broadly, with the capacity to be moved by practical reason that is not subordinate to inclination. Personality, so understood, is the same capacity as practical freedom. Since Kant thinks practical reason moves us independently of inclination only when we act on the moral law, he believes that the capacity to act on the moral law is the only one that satisfies the criterion for personality. But if prudential reasoning also satisfies the criterion for personality, we have no reason to believe that only the moral law reveals personality, or that the personality it reveals is only the capacity for morality. Kant suggests that prudence belongs to humanity rather than to personality, because prudential practical reason is subservient to other incentives (Rel. 27). He is right to say this, if a Humean account of prudence is right. But such an account does not fit prudence as Butler and Reid understand it. Kant treats as distinctive features of morality features of practical reason that Butler and Reid attribute to self-love as well as to morality. Their position, expressed in Kantian terms, claims that self-love presents us with categorical imperatives, and therefore reveals personality, not merely humanity, to us. If they are right, Kant loses his support for the claim that morality uniquely reveals personality. His discussion of prudence is incomplete, since he offers a purely hedonistic account of self-love, and does not examine the case that can be made for treating imperatives of self-love as categorical. Recognition of the claims of self-love tends to support Kant’s claim that the autonomous condition is valuable, but tends to undermine the prospect of finding any special defence of morality by appeal to autonomy. His claim about the role of morality in revealing freedom is open to question.  Rejection of this argument does not, however, require the rejection of connexions between morality and freedom that support morality. The reasons we can give for valuing the outlook of self-love may also give us reasons for valuing the outlook of morality. We might seek to show that the outlook of morality manifests autonomy to the highest degree. If the proper expansion of rational refelxion and autonomy through my different ends leads to the moral outlook, morality and full autonomy coincide, even though not every degree of positive freedom manifests morality.
- Before we try to answer this question, we need to return to our earlier question about the sort of freedom we discover through the moral law. What we have said so far may seem to do less than justice to Kant. For we have supposed that the moral law reveals practical freedom, and on that basis we have found reason to doubt his claim that the moral law uniquely reveals freedom. But he also claims that the moral law reveals our freedom by revealing our independence from the mechanism of nature.³⁰ We might reasonably take him to refer to his doctrine that the moral will is noumenal, and hence not subject to the deterministic laws that apply to nature. In his view, practical freedom implies transcendental freedom—the ability to act spontaneously, on one’s own initiative, and not because one is determined by past events. Transcendental freedom and spontaneity are incompatible with determinism. Kant infers that our awareness of our own agency requires us to believe in the falsity of determinism. Kant’s conception of practical freedom gives us no reason to introduce transcendental freedom. He rejects the simple compatibilism of Hobbes and Hume that makes internal causation suffciient for freedom. Kant argues that freedom also requires the capacity for being moved by practical laws, and hence by reasons that are independent of the strength of our desires. We have found no reason so far to believe that this capacity presupposes the falsity of determinism. Kant,however,believesthatifweallowpracticalfreedom,wemustrejectcompatibilism.³¹ He might believe this for either of two reasons: 
    - Perhaps practical freedom, as we have understood it so far, is incompatible with determinism. Even if the frist argument succeeds, it does not help his claim that morality uniquely reveals practical freedom. For if we have correctly explained practical freedom, it belongs to prudence as well as to morality; if it requires indeterminism, then prudence as well as morality requires indeterminism, and we have not yet discovered any special connexion between morality and freedom.
    - Perhaps our description of practical freedom so far is inadequate, because Kant attributes further features to it beyond those we have discussed, and argues that these further features require indeterminism. The second argument might be more helpful to Kant, if the additional features of practical freedom do not belong to prudence, but belong to morality.
- We should therefore consider the connexions that Kant affrims between practical freedom, morality, and indeterminism. We especially need to see whether:
    - His views about freedom reflect the demands of his moral theory - in the first case, any doubts that arise about his account of freedom may spread to parts of his moral theory.
    - Depend on his non-moral doctrines - in the second case, objections to his treatment of freedom may not affect his moral philosophy in particular.
- Kant connects practical freedom with transcendental freedom by this argument: 
    1. If we are practically free, we are not coerced by sensuous impulses. 
    2. If we are not coerced, we can do otherwise than we do. 
    3. If determinism is true, we cannot do otherwise than we do. 
    4. And so if determinism is true, we lack practical freedom. 
- The relevant feature of practical freedom seems to be its connexion with ought-judgments, and with responsibility, praise, and blame. But these features do not help Kant’s claim that morality uniquely reveals practical freedom. For they seem to belong to prudence no less than to morality. We often say that people ought to take more care of their health, for their own sakes; and, as Butler remarks, failures of prudence are ‘faulty and blameable’ (D 6).³⁶ If we take these features of prudence at face value, they reveal the truth of indeterminism no less than morality reveals it. Kant might argue that they are not to be taken at face value; but then he revives the question we have already raised, about whether he undermines his case about morality by questioning the categorical status of prudential reasons. In that case, indeterminism does not help Kant to show that morality uniquely reveals freedom. 
- Whether the argument for indeterminism applies only to morality or also to prudence, it is open to question. Kant relies on assumptions common to many incompatibilists. In particular, he relies on two claims (Examination of these two claims raises some questions about Kant’s argument): 
    - If we have the ability to do not-x, and are in a position to exercise it, it is possible for us to do not-x. The frist claim expresses a disputable view of the relation between ability and possibility. Against Kant, we might argue that responsibility and freedom require an ability to do otherwise that is present even in circumstances that make it impossible to do what we are able to do. Even if we grant that the past and the laws of nature make it necessary for me to do x, and make it impossible for me to do not-x in the same circumstances, we might argue that this impossibility does not interfere with the crucial ability to do not-x. 
    - The relevant sort of possibility is the one that is excluded if the past and the laws of nature determine that we will do x. If, then, we grant (2), we might reasonably reject (1). Alternatively, we might grant that ability to do otherwise implies some sort of possibility (thereby granting (1)), but still argue that it is possible for me to exercise my ability now if nothing in my internal states or the external conditions actually prevents me from doing x. The mere fact that I am causally determined to do not-x does not (according to this view) imply that I am prevented from doing x. In that case, compatibilists have no reason to accept both of Kant’s assumptions about ability and possibility in (1) and (2). 
- Hemayalsobegthequestioninasserting(2).Alternativepossibilitiesfitintoadeterministic world only if they involve a difference in the past or in the laws of nature: (3) If I can do not-x, even though I am determined to do x, it is possible for me to act so that the past or the laws of nature would have been different from what they were. One interpretation of (3) would be this: (4) If it is possible for me to act so that the past or the laws of nature would have been different from what they were, it is possible for me to change the past or the laws of nature. If it is open to me to change the past or the laws of nature in the way in which I change the future, backward causation is possible. If, however, backward causation is impossible, and (4) is true, alternative possibilities cannot be present in a deterministic world. We need not, however, agree that (4) follows from (3); not every case of acting so that the past would be different from what it was involves backward causation. If the British Parliament were to abolish the monarchy during the reign of Elizabeth II, it would make George VI the last king of England. If, however, a king succeeds Elizabeth II, and then the monarchy is abolished, Parliament will make George VI the penultimate king of England. It is easy to change these facts about the past, because they are ‘soft’ facts, logical consequences of choosing one or another future action; such changes do not require backward causation.³⁷ Compatibilists who accept (1) must accept (3), but soft facts raise a doubt about (4). Compatibilists who believe in alternative possibilities believe that it is possible for me to act in such a way that the past would be different from how it was. But this possibility does not require backward causation, if the relevant possibility rests on soft facts that are compatible with determinism. A compatibilist requires only the possibility of making the past different that follows from the existence of soft facts about the past. An argument that relies on (4), therefore, does not refute compatibilism. 
- We have tried to spell out the assumptions underlying Kant’s argument against the ‘wretched subterfuge’ of compatibilism. For all that we have said, the argument may be sound; but it does not seem dialectically effective against compatibilists, since they have plausible grounds for doubting some of the premisses. Kant does not show why they are wrong to combine the necessity that belongs to the past and the laws of nature with the ability and possibility that belong to practical freedom and responsibility. It is not clear that the necessity of the past and of the laws of nature excludes the possibility needed for the specific ability to do otherwise that is necessary for practical freedom. Hence practical freedom does not seem to require transcendental freedom. 
- A different, though not entirely separate, defence of Kant’s argument for indeterminism may be constructed from some aspects of voluntarism. He sets out, as the mediaeval voluntarists do, from a contrast between being compelled by the strength of one’s desires and freely choosing on the basis of reasons.³⁸ An intellectualist such as Aquinas identifeis this contrast with the contrast between being moved by one’s rational conception of the good and being moved by non-rational appetite. Kant, however, following other voluntarists, supposes that any sort of causal determination implies the compulsion that excludes free choice. Hence he rejects the intellectualist solution. It is difficult, however, to be convinced by this argument from voluntarism to indeterminism unless we are already sympathetic to incompatibilism. For intellectualists can explain our conviction that rational agency involves free choice rather than compulsion by one’s desires; their explanation ftis Kant’s description of practical freedom. In recognizing positive freedom, he affrims that we are more completely free when we are guided by practical reason. This corresponds to Scotus’ view that freedom is especially embodied in the affection for justice.³⁹ We have a reason to be dissatisfeid with an intellectualist account of practical freedom if we believe that we are free to reject practical reason as well as passion. Intellectualism denies us this freedom, because it claims that if we act against practical reason, we are either ignorant or compelled by passion. This voluntarist conception of freedom is at least part of Scotus’ view; Ockham defends it more single-mindedly. But it does not fit Kant’s position so well; for he identifies the rational will with practical reason, and identifies positive freedom with determination by the rational will. Hence it would be difficult for him to rely on a voluntarist argument for indeterminism. 
- Kant’s incompatibilism raises some difficulties for him, since he also believes in the truth of determinism, and indeed believes that our knowledge of nature implies determinism. He seems to be committed to the rejection of freedom. Our practical reason and our knowledge of nature, therefore, seem to give us contradictory answers about the truth of determinism. If the contradiction is genuine, we must reconsider our views about practical freedom or about our knowledge of nature. Kant, however, denies that our knowledge of nature contradicts our views about practical freedom. He suggests that our practical beliefs are true of things in themselves, whereas our claims about nature are true of appearances (KpV 42). Since our beliefs about freedom are not knowledge, they do not conflict with the doctrine that our knowledge is limited to appearances. If practical beliefs are about things in themselves, our knowledge of nature still allows Kant to claim that responsible actions are undetermined. But this result should not be his only reason for taking practical beliefs to be about things in themselves; if it were his only reason, he could fairly be accused of simply tailoring his conception of practical beliefs to fit indeterminism. In fact he has further reasons for taking practical beliefs, including those about morally good and bad responsible actions, to be about noumena. To show that moral features of actions are noumenal, and hence belong to things in themselves rather than to appearances, it is not enough to show that they cannot be directly observed in the way that colours or sounds can be; for something may be an appearance without being an object of the senses. In the First Critique, Kant distinguishes appearances from observables. He argues that the distinction between secondary and primary qualities does not correspond to his distinction between appearances and things in themselves,⁴⁰ because the former distinction applies only to observables, whereas some unobservable aspects of things belong to appearances, not to things in themselves.⁴¹ Empirical motives are not observable either, but they are appearances because they explain observable actions. 
- When Kant claims that noumenal events are undetermined, he does not mean that they are extra events beyond those that are part of the phenomenal order. The most plausible interpretation of transcendental idealism implies that appearances and things in themselves are the same things, under different aspects.⁴² Things in themselves are not different things from appearances, but the same things in different aspects. Things as appearances are things in so far as they have properties knowable in experience; the same things as things in themselves are things in so far as they do not have properties knowable in experience. Kant says, for instance, that an appearance has two sides, one of which treats the object in itself; the same object that appears to us also has properties that do not appear to us (A38/B55). When he distinguishes the object as appearance from the object in itself, he assumes that he is speaking of the same object in both cases (B69).⁴³ Kant considers the counterfactual possibility of our knowing things without reference to the senses. In that case, we would not know them simply as they appear, but in the actual circumstances, he implies, we do know these very same things as they appear. He does not mean, then, that there are things that we do not know. He means that there are some properties of things that we do not know. He does not imply that the properties that appear to us are any less objective than the properties that do not appear to us. 
- If we apply this understanding of transcendental idealism to freedom and determinism, Kant claims that my choice is an event about which we can say two things:⁴⁴ (1) It has properties that make it part of the phenomenal order, conforming to deterministic laws of nature. (2) It also has properties that make it an undetermined state of my rational self, and these properties are relevant to freedom and responsibility. It follows at least that our judgments about reasons for action and about responsibility are not ordinary empirical causal judgments. They do not simply describe or predict some connexion between cause and effect, and they do not report the results of our self-observation. When I assert that x is a reason for doing y, I think of x as a justifying reason; I set out to guide my behaviour, not simply to observe a particular causal force operating on me. Similarly, when I recognize that x was my reason for doing y, I think of x as an exciting reason that seemed to justify (to some degree) my doing y. Hence my judgments about reasons include a timeless element. If I judge that x is a reason for y, I do not mean that x precedes y and causes it; I mean that if x holds, it is to some degree reasonable to do y. The ordinary conception of causation, therefore, does not capture the relation between the reason and the action. In Kant’s view, the ‘causation’ that is relevant here is not the sort that holds between earlier and later events, but the ‘unschematized’ concept that he identifies with ‘ground and consequent’, displayed in conditionals.⁴⁵ In this case, we assert that the truth of the antecedent gives a reason for asserting the consequent. In the case of practical reason, we say that the antecedent gives a reason for bringing the consequent about. The phenomenal world is the area of empirical knowledge. Knowledge of phenomena is a part of our theoretical understanding of the sensible world, and it is the basis for predictions, hypotheses, and further extensions of our empirical knowledge. In Kant’s view, however, practical beliefs, including moral beliefs and assessments of merit and responsibility, are not part of our empirical knowledge; to learn more about morality is not to add further predictions about how aspects of the sensible world are likely to behave. We might be inclined to accept this claim about the non-predictive character of practical judgment if we consider deliberation and intention. These are not primarily predictions about what we will do; they guide us in the light of our assessment of the situation, and they are not falsified by the mere non-occurrence of what we decide or intend to do. Similarly, holding someone responsible for what he has done seems to be different from simply claiming that he has stood in a specific causal relation.⁴⁶ Some moral judgments, however, include causal, explanatory, and predictive elements, and so cast doubt on Kant’s claims. If I hold you responsible for a malicious or careless action, on the ground that you broke my window, I imply that you broke a window; if I discover that you never threw anything at the window, but a strong wind broke it, my judgment of responsibility is false. Similarly, my claim that someone is honest commits me to predictions; I believe, for instance, that if he is offered a small bribe to give false testimony in a murder case, he will probably refuse the bribe. Moral and other practical judgments may help to extend our empirical knowledge. But even if practical judgments are not entirely separable from empirical knowledge, Kant may still be right to argue that they do not primarily constitute empirical knowledge, and therefore are not about appearances. Moral judgments are those we make about ourselves and the world on the assumption that we are rational agents, not as inquirers into the world. For this reason, we may agree with Kant’s claim that moral judgments are not about appearances, and that therefore the properties that are essential to moral judgments are not phenomenal properties. If Kant is right about this, and about the basis of determinism, we have no reason to assume that moral properties are essentially involved in deterministic laws. For the determinist assumption, in his view, is required for knowledge of a single objective sensible world. It is part of the outlook of empirical knowledge, and so it cannot be transferred to the practical point of view from the point of view of empirical inquiry. It does not follow, however, that moral properties are phenomenally undetermined. To refrain from claiming that they are always phenomenally determined is a negative thesis that falls short of Kant’s indeterminist thesis. He does not simply claim that in giving reasons for actions, we do not think of reason and action as simply linked by ordinary empirical causation. He also claims that we believe that they are related by some sort of non-empirical causation, and believe that they are not related by empirical causation. In his view, we positively deny that our choices and actions belong to any empirical causal series. But this denial does not follow from the observation that the practical point of view is distinct from the point of view of empirical causal inquiry. His thesis about the undetermined character of our choices and actions presupposes incompatibilism; but he has not shown that this is a presupposition of the practical point of view. Kant’s argument for incompatibilism is open to question. 
- Kant’s various claims about determinism and freedom threaten to make his position incoherent. He believes that every event that is an undetermined, free choice of mine is also phenomenally determined (since phenomena and noumena are the same things). It follows that the ‘empirical character’ (as Kant calls it) of every such event is determined (KrV A539–41/B567–9; A551/B579). Since the phenomenal character of previous events is sufficient for the phenomenal character of this event, the noumenal character of previous events cannot make the phenomenal character of any event different from what it would have been if the phenomenal character of previous events had been the same and the noumenal character different. The noumenal character of an event cannot make any difference to its phenomenal character, since noumenal causation would be outside the series of phenomenal causes that determine the phenomenal character. The aspect of choice that makes us responsible for our actions cannot, therefore, affect the phenomenal character of our choices or actions. We may doubt these claims, if we return to Kant’s initial remarks on the difference between a free will and a purely animal will. We initially suppose that we are not coerced by sensuous impulses, because our rational reflexion makes some difference to what we actually do, and hence to phenomenal events—going to a film as opposed to staying at home. But if phenomenal events, apart from the noumenal aspect of my choice, determine my doing something with the phenomenal character of going to the film, the noumenal aspect of my choice does not give me much freedom to determine my action.⁴⁷ If this aspect does not affect the phenomenal character of actions, it does not seem to make us responsible for the phenomenal character of actions. But this is a surprising result, given our initial conception of practical freedom and responsibility. For we are normally held responsible for murder, theft, or (in the case of good actions) acting bravely in battle, making a sensible decision, or devising a successful strategy. All these descriptions refer both to our choices and aims and to the phenomenal character of the actions caused and explained (we assume) by these choices and aims. If, then, the moral motive explains observable actions, it must also be an appearance, according to Kant’s conception of appearances. Kant seems to discuss the wills of agents whose actions, including their phenomenal character, are explained by their acceptance of the moral law. States of a morally good or bad will, therefore, seem to be appearances. Kant creates these diffciulties because he does not accept compatibilism far enough to justify his transcendental idealist solution. He accepts some degree of compatibilism: our claims about responsibility have to be compatible with phenomenal causal determinism, so that the causality we exercise in free and responsible action cannot violate phenomenal determinism. Incompatibilists, however, may fairly reply that Kant’s position implies that no phenomenally determined action can be free. They can even quote Kant against himself. For he rejects compatibilism on the ground that if agents are determined to act by past events, and hence by events no longer in their power, they are not free (KpV 95).
- Since Kant accepts phenomenal determinism, he has a reason to reject the incompatibilist argument. Acceptance of compatibilism would undermine one of his reasons for believing that judgments about agency and freedom require transcendental idealism, but it would not remove all his reasons. Whatever he believes about determinism and compatibilism, he has good reasons for claiming that practical judgments are not ordinary empirical causal judgments. His position would be more plausible, however, if he acknowledged that judgments about reasons for action imply some judgments about phenomenal causation (so that, for instance, if I decide to stay at home rather than go out, I believe that some phenomenal mental act of mine will bring about one phenomenal effect rather than another). He ought to retain his beliefs about practical freedom and deny that it implies transcendental freedom. 
- we need not decide dogmatically in favour of compatibilism against incompatibilism. If we abstract from this dispute about free will, Kant’s views on practical freedom do not mark any sharp disagreement with the conception that Aquinas accepts and Hume rejects. His use of transcendental idealism to explain the difference between judgments about practical freedom and ordinary causal judgments is an important innovation; but it should be understood and evaluated apart from his claims about noumenal indeterminism.
- He argues that since the moral will is determined by the form and not by the matter of a maxim, it is determined by reason, hence not by the senses, hence not by appearances, hence not by past events.⁴⁸ This argument from non-sensory motivation to non-phenomenal motivation, and thence to indeterminism, is dubious. As we have seen, the world of appearances is the world that we know through sensory experience, plus whatever explains that experience; the mere fact that something is not an object of sensory experience does not imply that it is non-phenomenal. We should therefore ask: Does Kant believe that the moral motive contributes to the explanation of our experience? 
- The beginning of the Groundwork suggests that the moral motive explains some phenomenal actions. People who act from duty act fairly in cases where the shrewd shopkeeper would not, and they do this precisely because have a good will. We normally suppose that this ‘because’ is causal. If our alleged belief in the truth of the moral law exerted no causal infulence on our actions, we would normally regard this as a reason for denying that we have a morally good will. Similarly, if we act from a good will, belief that this action is morally required (apart from any further advantages) causally infulences our phenomenal action. According to Kant, therefore, the moral motive must be part of the phenomenal, and hence deterministic, series of causes and effects. Hence common moral beliefs require the moral motive to be phenomenal. This point is not affected by Kant’s view that it is often difficult to tell whether we act on the moral motive or not (G 407; R 75). He suggests that the possible concurrence of moral and non-moral motives, and our tendency to deceive ourselves about our motives, raise doubts about whether we really have a good will or not. Even if Kant is right about the difficulty of knowing people’s motives, the moral motive is relevant to the explanation of phenomena. For what we find difficult to decide is the degree to which the moral motive  influences our phenomenal actions. If the moral motive could not explain phenomena, it would not be difficult to know whether we act on the moral motive or not; it would be certain that we do not and cannot.⁴⁹ We may suppose that Kant can support his claim that the moral motive is non-sensible and noumenal, by arguing that all and only non-moral motives are ‘empirical’ (KpV 21), that they rely on subjective rather than objective principles (26), and that reason exhibits the moral law as ‘a ground of determination which is completely independent of and not to be outweighed by any sensuous condition’ (30). This argument relies on Kant’s different claims about sensuous impulses and empirical motives (Since Kant tends not to distinguish these three claims about non-moral motives, he is not clear about the extent to which considered moral judgments support his indeterminism): 
    1) Every motive except the moral motive rests on the desire for happiness, and ‘the lower faculty of desire’ (KpV 22), and so ultimately on feelings of pleasure rather than on any rational principle. In support of the first claim, he argues, reasonably, that morality assumes our capacity to be motivated by reason rather than passion (contrary to Hume).
    2) Every motive except the moral motive is empirical. For non-moral motives do not belong to human beings qua rational agents; they belong to us as beings with this or that taste or interest, or (in the case of more widely shared desires) as beings with these needs or interests distinct from those belonging to rational beings as such. Hence only the moral motive is a priori. The second claim is also defensible; morality requires us to be capable of acting on an a priori motive (i.e., one that belongs to rational agents as such), and hence, in one sense, on a non-empirical motive.
    3) Empirical motives are those that can appear in empirical causal laws, and therefore belong to the phenomenal world.⁵⁰ The third claim, however, does not follow from the first two. The sense in which the first two claims treat the moral motive as non-empirical does not imply that it is non-phenomenal.⁵¹ 
- Kant may be fortunate to have no cogent argument for his claims that the moral motive is the only noumenal motive and that action on the moral motive is the only action that is not determined by past events. For a cogent argument for these claims would create further difficulties. The argument that contrasts the ‘moral’ and ‘non-moral’ motive contrasts the motive of the morally good person with other motives. We refer to these other motives in our practical judgments and assessments about responsible agents, and so we consider them from the practical point of view. Hence, according to Kant, they are all noumenal motives and all undetermined. In acting on them, we exercise our practical freedom. But practical freedom (according to Kant) requires transcendental freedom. Hence, all responsible agents are phenomenally undetermined whenever they act responsibly. Since, according to common sense and to Kant, we can act responsibly even if we fail to act on the moral motive, our action on non-moral motives is sometimes undetermined. Hence the freedom of responsibility requires the sources of all responsible actions to be noumenal. This conclusion conflicts with Kant’s claim that only the moral motive is ‘non-empirical’ and therefore noumenal. That claim implies that everyone except the person with a morally good will acts on empirical motives, and that only action that proceeds from a good will is free action. But this claim about the extent of freedom raises questions about the freedom of responsibility.⁵² If action on a good will is the only undetermined action, and all action from ‘empirical’ motives is phenomenally determined, agents who act on morally good wills are the only responsible agents. But Kant rejects this conclusion. 
- These claims about the character of the good will suggest that Kant sometimes confuses the freedom of responsibility with the freedom of the good will. He seems to confuse them in an argument that he offers in the Groundwork for connecting freedom and morality. The faults in this argument help to explain some of the complications that he introduces into his account of freedom in other works. 
- Reflexion on morality shows that morality assumes there is a categorical imperative, and that it tells us what this alleged categorical imperative says. But a categorical imperative must give a reason to all rational beings as such—no matter what their specifci desires or impulses may be. Is there any such thing? Kant believes that an answer this question needs to explain the connexion between morality and freedom of the will. He accepts two claims: 
    - Awareness of the moral law reveals freedom to us. By being aware of moral obligation, we become aware that we are free in a way that we would not otherwise have recognized. 
    - Because we are free, the moral law is a categorical imperative for us. When we understand what freedom consists in, we see that it makes us the sorts of agents who have reason, irrespective of our particular desires, to follow the moral law.⁵³ 
- Kant frist defnies freedom as independence of alien causes.⁵⁴ He argues that ‘freedom must be presupposed as a property of the will of all rational beings’ (447). But then he also describes freedom as determination by laws that are the will’s own laws, and hence imply autonomy. Kant faces a dilemma. If he believes we are responsible for morally bad action, freedom is required for praise and blame; but if freedom is autonomy, good and bad people are equally autonomous. Alternatively, if only morally good people are autonomous, and freedom is autonomy, bad people are not responsible for their actions. Kant rejects both consequences, but it is difficult to see how he can avoid them, if he takes freedom to require both independence of alien causes and autonomy:
    - If freedom is to be identified with autonomy, all rational beings are autonomous; but this is not what Kant wants to prove.⁵⁵ 
    - If the autonomous will is the will of the morally good person, and if the autonomous will is the free will, the only people with free wills are morally good people. 
- It would be unfair to reject Kant’s attempt to connect freedom with noumenal causation because of these objections to the argument in the Groundwork. For we have seen that in the Second Critique and later works he distinguishes the freedom of responsibility from the freedom of moral autonomy. His division between negative and positive freedom separates the negatively free and responsible heteronomous agent from the positively free agent who has realized the capacity for autonomy that is present in all negatively free agents. But does this division make it easier or harder to defend Kant’s claims about indeterminism and noumenal causation? The division between the two types of freedom requires us to decide which type should be connected with noumenal causation and with indeterminism. Kant’s arguments against compatibilism apply to the freedom of responsibility. Unless we take negative freedom to require indeterminism, we give up all Kant’s reasons for believing that responsibility requires indeterminism. Hence we have a strong Kantian reason for claiming that negative freedom is incompatible with determinism. But indeterminism does not come in degrees; hence positive freedom does not involve less determination than negative freedom involves; they are equally phenomenally undetermined. This conclusion casts doubt on Kant’s attempt to identify the contrast between the moral motive and empirical motives with the contrast between phenomenal determination and noumenal causation. He affrims a special connexion between noumenal causation and the ‘non-sensuous’ moral motivation of the autonomous good will. But if noumenal causation is necessary for negative freedom, it does not distinguish the actions of morally good agents from the actions of other free agents. The connexion that Kant affrims between the non-sensuous, the non-empirical, the non-phenomenal, and the undetermined is difficult to accept. Kant’s improvements in his account of freedom raise questions, therefore, about transcendental and practical freedom. Either:
    - transcendental freedom explains nothing about responsibility, 
    - transcendental freedom explains nothing about moral motivation. We keep more of Kant’s position if we keep the link between transcendental freedom and responsibility, but abandon any link with moral motivation. We can retain his argument against compatibilism if we say that transcendental freedom is needed for negative freedom, but the difference between negative and positive freedom is unconnected with transcendental freedom. But if we go this far, we leave Kant with an unstable position. For if we admit that we can explain positive freedom without indeterminism, we invite a similar explanation of negative freedom. Negative freedom is the capacity for positive freedom; the rational will is capable of acting either on its own law or on a principle derived from inclination. This capacity seems to be explicable by reference to the agent’s deliberative capacities, without reference to undetermined causation. In that case, Kant does not need to reject a compatibilist account of freedom. 
- Our discussion of the noumenal will raises a further question about the compatibility of indeterminism with transcendental idealism. Though Kant believes that transcendental idealism reconciles the truth of indeterminism with the truth of phenomenal determinism, the reconciliation is not easy. Sometimes he claims that only the moral motive allows free action, so that the moral law is the only ground of determination that can determine a free will (KpV 29). If the will is free, it cannot be determined by any empirical condition, and so it must be determined by the form rather than the matter of a maxim, so that ‘freedom and unconditional practical law reciprocally imply each other’. This view of the free will is relevant to a question that arises for a voluntarist defence of indeterminism. It is difficult to see how, in a voluntarist view, the will is rational. It is even more difficult to see how the Kantian noumenal will is rational. For it is not only undetermined by any sort of rational consideration, but it cannot even be infulenced—as a voluntarist who is not a transcendental idealist might claim—by any such consideration; for infulence requires phenomenal causation, and hence temporal relations that are excluded for the noumenal will. In reply, we might distinguish determination by prior events from the determination that is part of rationality. As Aquinas explains, God’s knowledge does not rest on a process of reasoning in which previous events causally determine later ones so as to lead God to the right conclusions; for God does not think or act in time at all.⁵⁶ Still, God’s beliefs are necessitated, and therefore determined, by the truth, since it is not possible for p to be true and for God not to know p. Moreover God believes p because it is true, and it is false that p is true because God believes it. God does not have a choice about whether to believe what is true or to will what a benevolent agent would will; but this lack of choice does not make God any less free.⁵⁷ Kant might argue, then, that the freedom of the noumenal will consists in freedom from determination by previous events, but not in freedom from the rational determination that Aquinas attributes to God’s non-temporal agency. If he says this, he can explain how the noumenal will chooses rationally and is determined—though non-temporally—by rational considerations. This, however, is not a completely satisfactory answer. Voluntarist concerns about freedom raise doubts about whether God is really free, if he is determined in the way Aquinas allows; this is why Ockham doubts whether Aquinas has given good reasons for thinking God is free. Kant’s conception of the free will that necessarily follows a purely formal practical law is rather similar to Aquinas’ account of God’s freedom, in so far as it implicitly rejects the incompatibilist view that freedom requires the possibility of choosing otherwise. Even though the free will is not determined by previous events, it seems to be determined by rational considerations. If Kant shares voluntarist concerns about freedom, he should apply them to non-temporal agency. Hence he should deny that the noumenal will is essentially rational, and so accept more of the voluntarist account of freedom than he explicitly endorses. In that case, the free will may act on one or another motive, but there is no reason to suppose that it must act on just one sort of motive. Given Kant’s account of practical freedom, it is difficult to see why the free will must act on a moral motive rather than a sensuous motive; since neither of them determines it, it should be free to act on either. This objection to Kant suggests that there is no special reason to connect the moral will with freedom. 






# Difficulties

- Butler, Reid, and Sidgwick say that the rational pursuit of happiness gives us the reason that impartial justice is even more rational that pursuit of happiness. In trying to maintain the rationality of the affection for justice without allowing the rationality of the desire for happ
iness, Kant weakens his case for the supremacy of justice.
- The non-eudaemonist intellectualist interpretationofScotusanticipatesaKantianargumentforconnectingfreedomwithpractical reason. This argument raises difficulties for Kant that are parallel to some of the difficulties that we have found in trying to make room for Scotus’ voluntarism. Both Scotus and Kant may be better off with a more intellectualist conception of freedom than the one that they tend to accept. 
- Kant departs further than Butler departs from Aristotelian eudaemonism, since he rejects the naturalist account of virtue and the harmony of self-love and conscience. 
- Voluntarism is one element in the Kantian conception of the will. But Kant does not give up the connexion between the will and practical reason. The voluntarist aspects of his position conflict with the intellectualist aspects. He returns to Scotus’ belief that the affection for justice is somehow constitutive of, not simply one possible manifestation of, the freedom of the will; and so some of the objections to Scotus seem to fit Kant as well.
- The question draws attention to an important aspect of eudaemonism. We might wrongly take a eudaemonist to rely on an empirical, though universal, feature of human beings, that they desire happiness. This is how Kant interprets the desire for happiness.
- Kant's case against happiness does not apply directly to the traditional conception of happiness, as we find it in Aristotle and Aquinas. For they do not take happiness to consist simply in pleasure; hence Kant’s arguments that rest on claims about pleasure do not show that happiness cannot be the source of practical laws. 
- Is Kant right to claim that the highest good, as the ancients understand it, can yield only hypothetical imperatives? Let us suppose for the moment that the ancients regard the highest good egoistically, as one’s own good. In claiming that this yields only hypothetical imperatives, Kant denies that there are any categorical imperatives of prudence. His denial rests on the assumption that one’s good is happiness (as Kant understands it), or some other object of inclination. In that case, one’s own good is not an ‘objective determining ground’ that one has a reason to pursue apart from the strength of one’s own desire. We might, however, doubt Kant’s assumptions. One’s own good does not seem to provide only internal reasons based on antecedent inclination. We seem to have reason to pursue our own good even if we do not care enough about it; if I stop wanting to be healthy, I do not make it unreasonable to care about it; rather, I cease to want what it is still reasonable for me to want. My own good, therefore, ftis Kant’s conception of an objective end. Kant’s rejection of this conclusion relies on his questionable views about external reasons of prudence. 
- he tries to undermine our intuitive belief in prudential categorical imperatives. If he succeeded, he would cast doubt on the possibility of external justifying reasons. Such doubts would spread to moral imperatives. For he relies on the intuitive judgment that rational agents are sometimes open to moral criticism, however their inclinations may vary. IfKant arguesinthisway,hecannot fairly ignoreparallelargumentsforexternalprudential reasons. There must be some external reasons, if there are practical laws. If there are no practical laws, Kant’s whole argument collapses, and there are no categorical imperatives of morality. Hence, his objection to external prudential reasons ought to be more specific than a general Humean objection to external reasons. We might defend Kant by arguing that moral reasons are external, whereas prudential reasons are purely internal and dependent on the agent’s desires. But what would explain this difference between prudence and morality? Belief in external prudential reasons rests on claims about our nature and what is suitable for it. If Kant, following Hume, denies that such claims support external reasons, he undermines his claims about categorical imperatives, which apply to rational agents because they are rational agents, not because of some further desire. Doubts about prudential external reasons, therefore, seem to spread to moral external reasons. Since Kant accepts moral external reasons, he ought to accept prudential external reasons. 
- We might doubt the claim of traditional eudaemonism to rely on truths about rational agents as such, if we doubt whether there are any suffciiently determinate truths. Kant, however, does not share this general doubt, since he believes that truths about rational agents as such support practical laws in morality. He assumes that the case for prudential practical laws is weaker than the case for moral practical laws. His assumption is open to question. The best defence of his objections to prudential practical laws appeals to general Humean doubts about external reasons. If we do not share these doubts, it is difficult to reject prudential laws. But if we share Humean doubts about external reasons, we undermine Kant’s case for moral practical laws. 
- Kant’s inference about categorical imperatives is open to question, for reasons we have already noticed. If we allow external reasons that do not depend on an agent’s preference, we may recognize such reasons that depend on special features of particular agents, apart from their desires. Kant overlooks the possibility of imperatives based on such reasons. To support his conclusion about moral reasons, we must add the further premiss that moral reasons do not depend on peculiarities of some rational agents as opposed to others, any more than they depend on the preferences of particular rational agents. The arguments he offers for the universality of moral reasons support this further premiss. 
- His argument to show that the perfection of others cannot be an obligatory end is also questionable. Even though he is right to claim that I cannot, strictly speaking, achieve the perfection of others, ought I not to try to promote it? It is equally true that I cannot achieve the happiness of others, but none the less he believes their happiness is an obligatory end for me. Perhaps he means that, strictly speaking, promoting their happiness is an obligatory end; but, in that case, he ought also to say that aiming at their perfection is an obligatory end for me. 
- We should not, therefore, immediately endorse Kant’s rejection of appeals to human nature, even if we accept his objections to the specifci naturalist doctrines he discusses. His objections require him to depart from traditional arguments from human nature only if he correctly describes and evaluates the traditional arguments. Both his description and his evaluation are open to question. 
- To show that eudaemonists cannot give a satisfactory account of morality, Kant relies on two objections: 
    - Since the subordination of morality to the good reduces morality to a means to happiness, it conflicts with the demand that we choose morality for its own sake. This answer to Kant’s second objection does not answer his first objection. If we believe that prudential imperatives are categorical, but we still treat morality as simply an instrumental means to happiness, we violate Kant’s demand that we act on moral requirements for their own sake and not simply as a means. But Aristotle and Aquinas are not open to this objection, Neither of them regards morality simply as an instrumental means to be chosen only for the sake of happiness; they both regard morality as a non-instrumental good to be chosen as a part of happiness. 
    - Since imperatives of happiness are merely hypothetical, the subordination of morality to happiness treats moral imperatives as merely hypothetical. These two objections need to be considered, to see whether they affect all plausible versions of eudaemonism. The second objection fails, if we recognize categorical imperatives of prudence. If there are external prudential reasons, eudaemonism does not subordinate practical reason to inclination. According to the eudaemonist, I have a reason to pursue happiness not because I desire it, but because it is my ultimate good. Kant believes that in judgments of strict goodness ‘a principle of reason is thought of as already the determining ground of the will without reference to possible objects of the faculty of the desire’ (KpV 62). He believes that only moral judgments are judgments of strict goodness, but eudaemonists believe that principles derived from one’s own good meet the appropriate condition.⁶⁰ Kant’s second objection, therefore, does not defeat eudaemonist doctrines that treat prudential imperatives as categorical. Hence he has not shown that eudaemonism necessarily subordinates practical reason to inclination. If morality is subordinate only to the summum bonum, and the summum bonum provides external reasons, morality is not subordinate to inclination. The priority of the good to the morally right does not subordinate morality to inclination.
- Stoics agree with Kant’s view that morality embodies a common and impartial point of view that is appropriately shared between rational agents. The Stoics, however, argue that virtue achieves happiness; that is why they accept the supremacy of virtue. Kant rejects this eudaemonist claim, on the ground that it subordinates morality to inclination. His claims about the Stoics undermine his objection. Kant’s objections to naturalist eudaemonism would be sound if he were right to claim that all non-moral justifying reasons depend on inclination. If there are no categorical imperatives of prudence, the subordination of morality to the highest good in fact requires—even if the ancients did not see this—the subordination of morality to inclination. But since Kant does not always think the Stoics are open to this objection, he casts doubt on his view of justifying reasons. Since we have already seen grounds for doubting these claims, we have reason to doubt Kant’s objections to naturalist eudaemonism. 
- - Apart from these direct criticisms of eudaemonism, Kant also objects to Leibnizian perfectionism. Since this doctrine incorporates some elements of traditional naturalism, Kant’s objections also help to clarify his attitude to naturalism.⁶⁸ He argues that perfectionism agrees with sentimentalism in so far as it relies on an end that is an empirical object of the rational will. If Leibniz’s conception of perfection is non-moral—‘the ftiness or adequacy of a thing for all sorts of ends’ (KpV 41), it does not seem to give a reason to all rational wills. It seems to give a reason only to rational wills that happen to take some antecedent interest in non-moral perfection. Hence perfectionism reduces morality to a system of hypothetical imperatives. Leibniz’s claims about perfection are not clear on the point on which Kant attacks him. But one might argue, in Leibniz’s defence, that his idea of perfection is not this purely non-moral idea that Kant ascribes to him. It might be taken to include moral perfection as well. But if that is what Leibniz means, his view faces another of Kant’s objections to sentimentalism. For if we believe moral perfection gives us a reason for acting one way or another, we have already seen a reason to care about morality; hence perfectionism assumes what it seeks to prove. This is a version of an argument that Kant uses against a ‘refnied’ version of eudaemonism. defence of naturalism against Kant’s objections might reasonably concede one point. When Scholastic naturalism, following Aristotle, recognizes the right (the honestum) as the distinctively moral good, it does not try to subordinate the right to some non-moral good to which it is instrumental. But it does not necessarily commit itself to an unhelpful circle. defence of naturalism against Kant’s objections might reasonably concede one point. When Scholastic naturalism, following Aristotle, recognizes the right (the honestum) as the distinctively moral good, it does not try to subordinate the right to some non-moral good to which it is instrumental. But it does not necessarily commit itself to an unhelpful circle. This account of morality seems quite close to Kant’s position. He objects to intuitionist rationalism because it simply asserts the truth of moral principles without showing why they are true. In his view, we ought to show they are true by showing that they are practical laws that rational agents have reason to accept. Traditional naturalists try to show this by arguing that the right is what is suitable to rational nature. To see whether Kant disagrees with traditional naturalism on this point, we need to look more closely at the connexions he sees between morality and rational agency. 
- Moreover, the acceptance of categorical imperatives of prudence helps Kant to explain how rational agents have dignity and therefore deserve respect. Rational agency, not just moralagency,deservesrespect.Ifrespect isattachedtoarationalagent’srelationtorationally chosen ends chosen for the sake of the agent herself, it is easier to explain why the moral principles relying on respect for rational agents require respect for the self-regarding interests of rational agents, and not simply respect for the capacity of moral agents for morality. If this is the right account of Kant’s position, he would weaken his position if he were right to reject eudaemonism and traditional naturalism. If his claims about morality are right, his claims about prudential rational agency are wrong. This argument to show that Kant needs traditional naturalism has overlooked one apparently important further disagreement. Even if Kant were persuaded to allow categorical imperatives of prudence, his objections to eudaemonist naturalism would not be completely answered. For eudaemonism is a teleological outlook that makes one’s pursuit of a final good supreme. Even if we do not subordinate morality to the good by making it purely causal and instrumental, the structure of a eudaemonist outlook subordinates morality in some way; otherwise the claim about the supremacy of the final good is false. If Kant has a good reason to reject the type of subordination that follows from the teleological aspect of eudaemonism, he has a good reason to reject eudaemonist naturalism. His claim that eudaemonism makes moral imperatives hypothetical does not seem to be a good reason. To see whether he has a better reason, we need to look more closely at his views about the relation between morality and the final good. But even if these views give him a good reason to reject eudaemonist naturalism, they do not necessarily give a good reason to reject the non-eudaemonist naturalism of Butler.
- Our examination of Kant’s views on freedom has shown, therefore, that the aspects of transcendental idealism that involve indeterminism are not necessary for his moral philosophy. At most, they are necessary—if incompatibilism is correct—for the freedom of responsibility. When Kant appeals to transcendental idealism to explain the distinctive character of the moral motive, he introduces confusion into his position. Fortunately, he shows us how to remove this confusion, through his explanation of negative and positive freedom. This explanation suggests that, despite Kant’s claims about the noumenal will and the moral will, we should try to understand positive freedom without appeal to indeterminism.
