- Kant uses a counterfactual argument somewhat similar to Plato’s to argue that agents lack a good will and that their actions lack moral worth if they choose to do what duty requires for the sake of its good consequences. He concludes that we have a good will only if we choose ‘duty for duty’s sake’, so that we choose what is morally required precisely because it is morally required and not because of some further aspect of it that is not essential to its being morally required
- Rejects the supremacy of reasons based on one’s own good for being moral
- Non-eudamonism moralism is true: happiness is not needed for a sufficient justification of virtue.
- Against sentimrntalism, Kant argues that rational agents deserve respect from others, irrespective of anyone’s sympathies.
- We might even agree that virtue requires the choice of the right action for the right reason, looking to the very fact that makes the action right. This demand might be understood, as Kant understands it, non-teleologically, so that it does not refer to any connexion between virtuous action and one’s ultimate end.
- Apart from our moral beliefs, we have no reason to attribute freedom to human beings
- Kant’s contrast between acting on duty and acting on other motives: The two people he contrasts with the person acting out of duty are the trader who does the honest thing for the sake of his business and the philanthropist who acts out of his generous sentiments. The action of the philanthropist lacks moral worth not because it is selfish, but because his reason for doing the generous action rests ultimately on his generous impulses; if he lacked them, he would have lost his reason for these actions. Kant is primarily concerned with the distinction that Aquinas draws in his account of intellectual love.
- Pufendorf, then, seems to be open to the objections that Cudworth raises against Hobbes. Kant summarizes these objections in claiming that positive law presupposes natural law.⁴⁶ We might not agree with Kant’s claim that the ground of the authority of a legislator of positive law must be moral, and therefore must be part of natural law. But his claim is plausible if we consider a legislative theory of the natural moral law itself; the non-moral grounds that Pufendorf offers do not vindicate the authority of a moral legislator. Hence at least one natural law cannot itself be valid simply because it has been legislated by a divine legislator. This is why Kant, while conceding that we may call God a legislator, denies that God is the author of the moral law.
- Kant describes the pursuit of one’s own perfection and the happiness of others as duties of virtue, as opposed to right. His division between duties of virtue and of right seems to affirm a division that Leibniz rejects. 
- Butler believes Clarke goes too far in rejecting naturalism; the restoration of some aspects of traditional naturalism is Butler’s answer to sentimentalism. Kant’s objections to rationalism are similar to Butler’s in some important ways that are not completely obvious. Once we see these similarities, we can more easily see the ways in which Kant’s answers to the objections do and do not differ from Butler’s return to traditional naturalism. 
- A variation of Hutcheson’s constructivism might substitute a rational procedure for the reactions of the moral sense. This is approximately the form of constructivism favoured by Kant, according to some views of his position
- Balfour relies on the Socratic and Stoic view (later exploited by Kant) that virtue consists in the good use of other goods;
- considerations suggest that rational intuition of independent sui generis facts is not a satisfactory conclusion for a rationalist to reach. If we find the rationalist position unsatisfactory, we may react in different ways: 
    - We may decide that sentimentalism is right after all.
    - We may decide that the appeal to independent facts is mistaken. This question is connected with a question about the nature of Kant’s rejection of rational intuition; does this lead him to a version of the second reaction as well as the third? Some of his views encourage interpreters to believe that his rejection of rationalism includes the rejection of objectivism. We need to see whether this is Kant’s position, and whether he has a good reason for regarding it as the most reasonable reaction to the intuitionist aspects of rationalism.
    - We may decide that the separation of moral truths from truths about rational agents is mistaken. Kant is dissatisfied both with empiricism and with the rationalism that leads to undefended intuitions. Part of his strategy can be described as an expression of the third reaction; for he takes the connexion between a theory of rational agency and a theory of morality to be much tighter than it appears to be in rationalist conceptions. To this extent he develops a central aspect of Butler’s position (despite his ignorance of Butler) that is obscured by Price and Reid (despite their knowledge of Butler).
Still, Kant does not revive mediaeval naturalism; he rejects it even more clearly than the rationalists do. His rejection is implicit; he does not seriously consider the Aristotelian position defended by Aquinas and his 16th-century supporters, and his explicit references to Greek ethics are rather brief and inexact. We will have to examine his reasons for rejecting the naturalist position, and see how far they leave him from the position common to Aquinas and Butler.
- Kant’s attitude to rationalist intuitionism and sentimentalism in ethics may be compared with his attitude to rationalism and empiricism in metaphysics and epistemology:
    - In the First Critique, he agrees with rationalists against empiricists in believing that there are true non-empirical principles in addition to the truths grasped by experience. But he does not simply assert that these are innate principles, or that they are grasped by rational intuition (Kant criticizes innatism at KrV B167–8). He argues that they are true and non-empirical. In his view, we must recognize their truth and their non-empirical character if we admit any empirical knowledge, or even admit some basic truths about self-consciousness. If he is right, we must reject empiricism if we believe some elementary truths that an empiricist must believe. Kant tries to do something similar in his moral philosophy. He wants to display the rational necessity of the moral point of view, to those who accept moral judgments, or even any plausible conception of rational agency. 
- He argues, therefore, in two different directions (These two different directions of argument should agree in their conclusions. On the one hand, the kind of agent who is presupposed by morality ought to be one whom we can reasonably believe to exist. On the other hand, the principles that a rational agent has reason to accept ought to include recognizably moral principles):
    - ‘regressive’ (or ‘analytic’) - argues from common-sense convictions about morality and moral reasons, to an account of the sort of agent and the sort of will that can be moved by such reasons. Problem 1 is: Granted something about morality, find the sort of will that is determined by it alone.
    - ‘progressive’ (or ‘synthetic’) - The progressive method begins from claims about rational agency — the sorts of agents that we take ourselves to be, and the sorts of reasons that concern us. It argues from these claims to an account of the practical principles that we have reason to accept. Problem 2 is: Granted a free will, find the law that alone is competent to determine it necessarily. 
- The two central concepts that Kant relies on are those of morality and of freedom, which he connects closely with rational agency. Through the moral law we discover the principles that move a will if there is any free will; but we still need some further argument to show that the kind of free will postulated by the moral law is possible.³ 
- We might reasonably compare Kant’s two directions of argument with those that Aristotle distinguishes - one begins from what is ‘more knowable to us’ and proceeds towards the principles that are ‘more knowable by nature’:
    - The principles are ‘more knowable by nature’ because they capture the real explanatory and justifciatory relations between the ordinary convictions we begin with and the less accessible truths that underlie these convictions. A progressive argument setting out from the principles known ‘by nature’ ought not to take the truth of our moral convictions for granted, but ought to justify our conviction of their truth by further principles. In the First Critique, Kant distinguishes a question of fact from a question of right (quid iuris), and takes the second question to require an answer giving a ‘deduction’ that constitutes a justification.⁵ Similar questions seem to be relevant to morality. We find an ‘apparent contradiction between the mechanism of nature and freedom’ (KpV 97). If we could go no further, we would have to conclude that our moral convictions lead us to believe something that we have good reason to reject.
- In Kant’s view, however, the conception of freedom we reach through morality is also reasonable in its own right, and therefore supports the rationality of our moral beliefs. To this extent he offers a ‘deduction’ for practical reason. He claims that our moral beliefs are the foundation of our belief in freedom, and our belief in freedom is the foundation of our moral beliefs. These two claims are consistent, and indeed support each other, if they refer to different types of foundation.
- It seems that Kant did not know about Butler, Balguy and Price.
- Kant knew about Hutcheson, Leibnitz and Wolff
- Kant may knew about Aristotle, Seneca, Cicero and Cudworth.
- To grasp the extent of Kant’s disagreement with sentimentalists, we need to consider whether he rejects their account of practical reason and motivation in general, or only their account of moral reason and motivation.
- If Kant rejects both the ungrounded intuitions of Clarke and Price and the mutability resulting from sentimentalism, we might expect him to consider the position that we have called ‘traditional naturalism’:
    - Kant returns, in one respect, to traditional naturalism - He rejects the immediacy of rightness, as Clarke tries to explain it. In his view, right action is fitting for a rational agent; we cannot see the rightness of an action by inspecting the action in itself, but we must see it in relation to the rational agent who does the action. In recognizing this relational and contextual aspect of rightness, Kant is closer to Butler and to Suarez than to Clarke.
    - On another point, however, he abandons naturalism - He argues that we cannot explain or defend morality through an account of human nature; naturalism tries to rest morality on ‘anthropology’. His explicit objections, however, are not aimed directly at traditional naturalism, but at Humean naturalism. He does not discuss the normative version of naturalism that the Greek moralists, Aquinas, and Butler all accept. Perhaps he agrees with Wollaston and Hume who, despite their sharp disagreements on the nature of morality, agree that a normative conception of nature has no role in an account of morality.
    - Whatever Kant says, it is not always clear that he rejects normative naturalism. Sometimes he simply seems to replace fitness to rational nature with fitness to rational beings. He seems to disagree, therefore, with traditional naturalism only in denying that the rational aspect of rational beings is a feature of their nature. We may wonder whether he is entitled to draw the line between the natural and the non-natural where he does.
- Kant’s conception of the basis of our moral knowledge raises a question about whether he means to defend objectivity or to replace it. He argues that we have a priori knowledge of moral properties; our knowledge rests on necessary features of rational and moral agents. We might say (perhaps exaggerating the parallel with the First Critique) that some moral facts are necessary for the possibility of our experience of ourselves as moral agents.¹⁶ But then we might ask whether these necessary features of our experience tell us about objective moral facts, or simply about our experience. The question about Kant’s realism or anti-realism in the First Critique returns when we consider his practical philosophy.  This comparison with the First Critique needs to consider the differences that Kant sees between theoretical and practical philosophy. Since moral beliefs are not suitably connected to our empirical knowledge, they cannot be about appearances; hence, if they are true about anything, they must be true about things in themselves. But in that case must they not give us knowledge of things in themselves, contrary to the First Critique? Our views about the meta-ethical implications of Kant’s views depend on specific claims about his ethical arguments, and on more general claims about the connexion between his practical philosophy and the rest of his philosophical position. Some of the main interpretative issues can best be decided when we have discussed Kant’s views on freedom. 
- Kant agrees with Butler, Price, and Reid in accepting a rationalist account of the nature and basis of morality, even though he does not rely on intuitionism to support rationalism. He agrees with their view that rationalism conflicts with utilitarianism.
- Perhaps Kant describes the moral point of view at a very general level that is neutral between different normative views.
- Kant contrasts a practical law with a mere maxim. My maxim in doing a particular action is (approximately) my reason for acting as I do. The maxim on which I do this action gives the description under which I choose to do it. If, for instance, I brush my teeth, my maxim is (normally) keeping my teeth clean. We might capture the maxim by saying that I brush my teeth to keep them clean, or that what I am doing in brushing my teeth is keeping my teeth clean (rather than wearing out the brush or exercising my arm).²² A mere maxim, unrelated to any practical law, appeals to a motive that may be present in different rational beings to different degrees. A practical law, by contrast, rests on some ground that applies to rational beings as such.²³ (Kant’s different remarks on maxims and laws seem to reflect some confusion. Sometimes he suggests that a maxim is a subjective principle and a law is an objective principle that we may or may not incorporate in our subjective principle; the law provides a justifying reason that becomes a motivating reason when it is incorporated in our maxim. See G 421n. In this sense both hypothetical and categorical imperatives should give practical laws. But Kant also (in KpV) seems to say that all laws are a priori, and the hypothetical imperative is a mere maxim. Perhaps he confuses different ways something can be subjective). Kant sets out to prove three claims: 
    - A practical law is a principle with a certain form. Kant fulflis his frist task by arguing that no material practical principles are laws (KpV 22), and that a law contains the determining grounds of the will (27). The only such law is the one that requires us to act on a maxim that could be a principle establishing universal law (30). 
    - There are principles with this form, and hence there are practical laws. In drawing a corollary from this ‘fundamental law of practical reason’, Kant fulflis his second and third tasks at once. He asserts that ‘pure reason is practical of itself alone, and it gives (to man) a universal law, which we call the moral law’ (31). 
    - Moral principles rest on practical laws. He does not argue separately that moral principles are practical laws; he explicates his conception of practical laws by reference to assumptions about morality. Suppose that you consider the maxim of denying that a deposit has been made when no one can prove the contrary, and you ask whether this maxim could be a universal law (27). Kant assumes that this question concerns the moral acceptability of the maxim. Similarly, in arguing that a free will must be determined by a pure and unconditional practical law, he appeals to our recognition of our ability to do what we regard as morally obligatory, apart from the comparative strength of our various desires (30). Our awareness of moral obligation is awareness of a practical law.²⁴ 
- Kant claims that principles are practical laws if they rely on some condition that is ‘recognized as objective, i.e., as valid for the will of every rational being’ (KpV 19). He does not mean that all rational agents recognize them as valid. He treats them as justifying reasons, not as exciting reasons, for all rational agents. In his view, not all justifying reasons rest on the desires of the agents for whom they are justifying reasons. Some reasons rest on facts about agents that they may not recognize or care about. Practical laws are valid for the will of every rational being, because of facts about rational beings, not primarily because of what rational beings recognize or desire. 
- Practical principles are laws if they ‘contain the determining grounds of the will because of their form and not because of their matter’. The matter of a practical principle is ‘the object of the will’. Every practical principle has an object whose role determines the character of the principle. If the object is also the determining ground of the will, the principle is not a practical law. In a practical law, the form of the principle, abstracted from the object, gives the determining ground. A purely formal justifying reason distinguishes practical laws from those justifying reasons that depend on some further feature of a specific kind of rational agent. The contrast between form and matter relies on the contrast between empirical desires and reasons that apply to rational agents as such. Kant does not mean to contrast form with content; the distinctive feature of moral principles is not purely ‘formal’, in the familiar sense referring to grammatical or logical form in contrast to content.²¹ Kant means that no particular purpose resting on inclination implies that an action is done from duty; for such a purpose presupposes that the agent already desires the end. The agent’s maxim should have the characteristic, not yet explained, of a genuine moral principle. Kant’s objection to empirical objects of desire is summed up in his claim that we have no antecedent feeling tending to morality.²² If moral reasons relied on antecedent feeling, they would not support our praise and blame of rational agents as such. If they do not rely on antecedent feelings, they are justifying reasons because of their form, as Kant understands ‘form’. We do not yet know how much moral content belongs to reasons that apply to rational agents as such. 
- Kant distinguishes (in order to act, the agent needs both the objective ground and the subjective ground — both a representation of the state of affairs aimed at and a desire to realize it.²⁸):
    - The objective ground of self-determination — the end (Zweck), which is also the ground of determination (Bewegungsgrund) of the action - If someone wants to eat an apple, the eating of the apple is the objective ground; it is the intentional object, or state of affairs represented as desirable. Kant uses ‘objective’ in the Scholastic sense, referring to the object of thought.²⁷ The objective ground need not be an existing object, and need not be valid for all rational agents. It is objective simply because it is a represented state of affairs, rather than an attitude the agent takes to it:
        - Objective ends - External Reasons. Kant connects practical laws with objective, as opposed to subjective, ends. Objective ends have to do with grounds of determination (representation of the state of affairs) that hold good for every rational being. Objective ends do not depend on grounds of determination; they are grounds of determination, as he has said above. He does not mean that objective ends depend on something else, or that they depend on ‘motives’ (as we would normally understand them). With objective ends, the relation between the desire and the desirable object is reversed. Our having a justifying reason to aim at this end does not depend on our already desiring it; on the contrary, it is because we recognize some justifying reason to aim at this end that we come to desire it. Objective ends are those ends, in which the reason is antecedent to the desire. Not all objective ends apply to all rational agents as such. If there are ends that certain kinds of rational beings have reason to pursue, not all objective ends are valid for every rational being in the sense Kant has in mind -  perhaps, for instance, agents who have some considerable degree of artistic, musical, or athletic talent have some reason (not necessarily overriding) to develop it, irrespective of what they may already desire. This external reason is an appropriate basis of action for some, but not all, rational agents. An objective end is therefore a limiting condition of everyone’s freedom of action (G 430–1). Our freedom of action is the freedom to pursue the subjective ends we may have; the objective end limits, but does not supersede, the pursuit of subjective ends. 
        - Subjective ends - Internal Reasons. Though subjective ends ‘rest on’ incentives (motives in contemporary English), they are not themselves incentives, but the states of affairs we aim at. We have subjective ends in so far as some things become desirable to us because we already desire them; this is the only way, according to Hume, in which an end can become desirable to us. In these cases, we can distinguish the desire or ‘spring’ (incentive) from the desirable state of affairs, and the desire is prior.
    - The subjective ground of desire (Begehren) — the incentive (or ‘spring’, Triebfeder) that causes me to do the action. The ‘incentive’ is the agent’s desire for the object. We often use ‘motive’ as Kant uses ‘incentive’ here,
- An agent’s purpose (desire to realize the state of affairs) or object (representation of the state of affairs) cannot belong to a practical law, because Kant has a narrow conception of purposes and objects. In his view, they are all the products of empirical desires and impulses, and therefore are empirical objects of the will. These empirical objects may vary from one agent to another (whether or not they actually vary). If they were the basis of moral principles, the reasons given by moral principles would also vary according to the different desires of different agents. These empirical objects could not support practical laws. But this conclusion might still allow an object of desire to be the basis of practical laws. ‘Object of desire’ might refer either to what a given agent desires or to what is desirable for, or ought to be desired by, this sort of agent. If something is desirable for all rational agents as such, whether or not they desire it, it could be the basis, for all Kant has said so far, of practical laws. Kant has not shown that there can be no such object of desire; and therefore he has not shown that no object of desire could be a basis for practical laws. 
- Kant assumes that practical laws must be known a priori, but he gives no distinct argument for this claim. He refers to ‘the necessity which is conceived in every law, an objective necessity arising from a priori grounds’ (KpV 26), and remarks that ‘practical laws ... must have an objective and not just subjective necessity, and ... must be known a priori by reason instead of by experience’ (KpV 26). They must be known a priori because they apply to rational agents as rational.²⁹ Practical laws are derived from the ‘universal concept of a rational being generally’ (G 412); we can understand them without reference to mere empirical facts about human beings. 
- Kant’s contrast between price and dignity (G 434–5) draws the same distinctions as with Objective and Subjective ends. Whatever has a price has relative value; its price is what it would take for me to give it up in favour of some other goal. Something of absolute value cannot have that sort of price. Kant assumes that price is fxied by degree of antecedent desire; I fnid the price of x when I fnid some y such that I want y more than I want x and I would have to give up y in order to keep x. Objective ends do not have this sort of price, since their value is not fixed by the strength of the desire that I happen to have for them; and so they have a different kind of value from the value attached to things with a price.
- The basis of Kant’s division between practical laws and maxims, and between objective and subjective ends, is also the basis of his division between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. This division rests on the relation of different imperatives to empirical motives and inclination. When Kant speaks of imperatives, he refers to laws as they apply to agents who have motives that potentially conflict with practical reason. Practical laws move purely rational agents without being imperatives, but they are imperatives in agents who have potentially conflicting sources of motivation.³³ Kant normally discusses agents for whom practical laws are imperatives, since all human agents belong to this class. But his claims about reasons and about moral goodness do not require the potential internal confilct that is needed for imperatives.³⁴ :
    - Hypothetical imperative - counsel, rather than command. results from justifying reasons that rest on some particular empirical desire or impulse. Hypothetical imperatives depend on an antecedent inclination. This inclination may be actual, not merely possible. ‘Since you want x, you ought to do y’ is a hypothetical imperative no less than ‘If you want x, you ought to do y’ is.³⁵ The relevant inclination may even be unavoidable. The desire for happiness is universal and necessary for human beings with our specific mental and physical characteristics, but it results in hypothetical imperatives (G 417). This explanation of the difference between categorical and hypothetical imperatives suggests that hypothetical imperatives rest ultimately on a desire for pleasure. This particular feature of Kant’s position, however, is not necessary for his main contrast between the two types of imperatives.⁴¹ 
    - Categorical  imperative - relies on justifying reasons that are independent of empirical desires. A practical law is based on a reason that is independent of the agent’s desires and inclinations. It must present external justifying reasons that are reasons for all rational agents as such, not because some rational agents have the particular aims and needs that human beings have. Such reasons do not cease to be reasons simply because human inclinations change. If we care less about our happiness today than we did yesterday, such a fluctuation of inclination makes different hypothetical imperatives apply to us, but it does not change the practical laws that apply to us as rational agents. Kant’s treatment of happiness makes it especially clear why we need to distinguish two features of categorical imperatives (These two criteria for a categorical imperative are equivalent only if we accept some controversial features of Kant’s view of external reasons. In his view, all non-moral reasons are internal reasons, so that the only external reasons are moral reasons applying to all rational agents as such. But we might reasonably suppose that some of them meet the broader, but not the narrower, criterion for being categorical. Some imperatives apply to some rational agents and not to others, but not because of different preferences. These imperatives might include: (a) People with musical talent ought to develop it. (b) After that serious illness, you ought to take it easy for a while. These imperatives seem to rest on external reasons, independent of any prior preference of the agent; and so, by this test, they are not hypothetical, but categorical. But they seem to apply to some agents and not to others, not to all rational agents as such. One might reply that these imperatives based on external reasons may really apply to all rational agents. Perhaps all rational agents as such have reason, if they have musical talent, to develop it. This ‘conditional’ categorical imperative is different from a hypothetical imperative, because the condition it includes does not involve the agent’s desires. The fact that all imperatives based on external reasons apply to all rational agents in this sense may make it easier for Kant to believe that his narrower conception of a categorical imperative includes all non-hypothetical imperatives. Kant’s conception of a categorical imperative, however, normally requires not this conditional universality, but unconditional universality; he takes a categorical imperative to rest on an external reason that applies unconditionally (i.e., without essentially referring to any conditions distinguishing one rational agent from another) to all rational agents as such. His claims about the features of a categorical imperative apply to unconditionally universal categorical imperatives. ): 
        - Kant’s broader account of a categorical imperative takes every non-hypothetical imperative to be categorical. 
        - His narrower conception restricts categorical imperatives to those that rely on reasons that are equally reasons for all rational agents as such. 
- How many practical laws are there? Kant has clear reasons to deny that technical imperatives, concerned with the satisfaction of particular empirical desires, are practical laws. His reasons for dismissing pragmatic imperatives, derived from happiness, need closer examination.
- The objections to principles based on happiness rest on objections to all ‘practical principles which presuppose an object (material) of the faculty of desire as the determining ground of the will’. In Kant’s view, no such principle can be the basis of moral principles (KpV 21). The ‘material of the faculty of desire’ is an object whose reality is desired. If the desire for the object precedes any practical rule, the principle is empirical. In such cases, pleasure presents an end for the practical rule to achieve. The practical rule, therefore, is merely empirical, because we cannot know a priori whether or not we will gain pleasure.³⁶ 
- Empirical Principle - Principle, in which the desire for the object precedes any practical rule. In such cases, pleasure presents an end for the practical rule to achieve. The practical rule, therefore, is merely empirical, because we cannot know a priori whether or not we will gain pleasure.³⁶
- Material practical principles - aim at pleasure. Kant claims that they all belong under ‘the general principle of self-love or one’s own happiness’ (22). He identifeis pleasure with the ‘sensation of agreeableness’ produced by the achievement of some objects of desire.³⁷ 
- Principle of Self-Love - principle, which make a happiness (rational being’s consciousness of the agreeableness of life which without interruption accompanies his whole existence) the supreme ground for the determination of choice (Willku¨r). ‘We find now, however, our nature as sensuous beings so characterized that the material of the faculty of desire (objects of the inclination, whether of hope or fear) first presses upon us; and we find our pathologically determinable self, although by its maxims it is wholly incapable of giving universal law, nonetheless — as though it constituted our whole self — striving from the start to make its claims primarily and originally valid. This propensity to make oneself, in accordance with the subjective determining grounds of one’s choice (Willku¨r), into the objective determining ground of the will (Wille) in general one can call self-love (Selbstliebe), which, if self-love makes itself legislative and makes itself into the unconditioned practical principle can be called self-conceit (Eigendu¨nkel).’ In doing this, we mistakenly suppose that we need no further reason apart from inclination in order to have a good reason to act on our inclinations. Self-love exaggerates its importance even more when it ‘makes itself legislative and makes itself into the unconditioned practical principle’; this exaggerated attitude is ‘self-conceit’. Self-love and self-conceit differ in that self-love regards one’s own interest as an objective determining ground, without claiming that it is the supreme determining ground, whereas self-conceit claims supremacy for one’s own interest in contrast to any other motive (73).⁴⁷ In both attitudes, the rational will accepts maxims that aim at the satisfaction of inclination, on the false assumption that these maxims give us an objective determining ground. An objective determining ground would give us good reason, apart from our inclinations, to promote our own happiness. If happiness does not give us an objective determining ground, it does not give us external reasons—considerations that constitute good reasons for action, independently of the inclinations of the subject. This conception of happiness requires the Humean conception of hypothetical imperatives, even though Kant himself does not unambiguously endorse this conception.⁴⁸ 
- Assertorical Imperative - The hypothetical imperative which represents the practical necessity of action as means to the promotion of happiness. We may not expound it as merely necessary to an uncertain and a merely possible purpose, but as necessary to a purpose which we can a priori and with assurance assume for everyone because it belongs to his essence.’
- Kant accepts a hedonist account of happiness, identifying happiness with the awareness of durable and uninterrupted pleasure. Some of Kant’s remarks, however, suggest a non-hedonist conception of happiness. Knowledge of happiness rests on ‘mere data of experience’ (KpV 36), and it is difficult to find the elements of happiness (G 417–18).³⁸ This difficulty would not arise if happiness consisted entirely in the pleasure resulting from the satisfaction of desire; for in that case the only constituent element of happiness would be pleasure, and the diffciulty would lie not in identifying the elements of happiness, but in fniding the means to happiness. Perhaps, however, we should take Kant to be speaking inexactly in suggesting that the elements of happiness itself are difficult to find. He may simply mean that it is difficult to discover what gives us pleasure.³⁹ Kant has shown that happiness, as he understands it, does not support categorical imperatives or practical laws, as he understands them.
- A hedonist analysis of desire supports Kant’s claim that no principle based on the agent’s highest good can be a practical law.⁴⁰ If this analysis is right, his criticism of happiness is cogent. If practical rules are prescriptions for achieving happiness, they depend on the agent’s feelings of pleasure.
- Kant contrasts:
    - Judgments of Weal - good assessed by reference to effectiveness in satisfying inclination (in the short or the long term) 
    - Judgments of Strict Goodness - good assessed by reason independently of inclination
- If happiness consists in the satisfaction of our inclinations (or most of them, or those we care most about, or a consistent set of them), judgments about what is required for happiness refer to the goodness that depends on inclination, and hence refer to weal rather than to strict goodness. In Kant’s view, the necessity of our pursuing happiness is a necessity of the human condition, not of practical reason, so that it depends on empirical facts about the strength of our inclinations.⁴³ 
- Imperatives based on happiness manifest our predisposition to humanity; the self-love that aims at happiness ‘is rooted in a reason which is indeed practical, but only as subservient to other incentives’. Only the predisposition to personality, involving the capacity for respect for the moral law as in itself a sufficient incentive of the will, is really ‘rooted in reason practical of itself, i.e., in reason legislating unconditionally’
- Kant’s treatment of reasons of self-interest is not completely clear. We need to distinguish three possible places for reason in prudential deliberation: 
    - Given that you want x, reason tells you that y is a means to x - Kant accepts it.
    - Reason tells you that it is reasonable to pursue y, given that you want x and y is a means to x - One might be inclined to ascribe the second claim to him.⁴⁵ He seems to suppose it is rational to pursue means to our ends, and that we do not need a further inclination in order to make this rational. If, however, we cannot plausibly accept the second claim without the third, Kant’s position is unstable. Though he is fairly clear about the sort of reason provided by a hypothetical imperative, he is less clear about the rationality of following hypothetical imperatives. 
    - Reason tells you that it is reasonable to pursue y, given that x is good for you, and y is a means to x - He rejects the third claim, since he rejects categorical imperatives of prudence. 
- Kant’s treatment of happiness makes it especially clear why we need to distinguish two features of categorical imperatives: (1) Kant’s broader account of a categorical imperative takes every non-hypothetical imperative to be categorical. (2) His narrower conception restricts categorical imperatives to those that rely on reasons that are equally reasons for all rational agents as such. 
- though Kant sees that the ancients regard the highest good (virtue and pleasure), rather than happiness (which is the pleasure), as the ultimate end, he still believes that they subordinate practical reason to inclination. In his view, the appeal to the highest good is an appeal to an object of inclination that can yield only hypothetical imperatives.⁵³ Hence the ancients introduce the ‘heteronomy’ of practical reason, because they do not allow practical reason to follow its own laws, but they make it subservient to inclination.⁵⁴ 
- Kant’s separation of practical laws from inclination-based maxims matches Aquinas’ division between the desires that belong to the will and those that belong to the passions. Aquinas agrees that practical reason is capable of fniding ends that apply to us independently of antecedent non-rational inclinations, and that we are capable of acting on them. But he holds, contrary to Kant, that one’s own good is a source of practical laws, as Kant conceives them. Kant rejects this view because he identifies one’s good with the satisfaction of inclination. On this issue, Kant is less rationalist than eudaemonist naturalists are.
- Kant does not endorse Hume’s general objections to external justifying reasons. Kant believes that moral imperatives give external reasons. He assumes that agents deserve criticism for acting against reason, whatever their inclinations may have been, if they violate principles of morality. If they did not deserve it, the imperative of morality would not be categorical. 
-  He defends claims about external reasons that we might accept without believing that all and only moral principles are practical laws. The next stage in a clear presentation of Kant’s position ought to show how moral principles are practical laws. Kant offers two sorts of arguments for this conclusion about moral principles:
    - Our views about morality, reasons, praise, and blame imply that moral principles are practical laws. We may begin, therefore, with the description of our moral beliefs that Kant takes to support his first claim. In the Groundwork, he begins by claiming that the good will is the only sort of good that we can regard as good ‘without limitation’ (He does not mean that a good will is the only thing that has non-consequential (and in that sense ‘intrinsic’) goodness; he means that we take moral goodness to mark the limit of the goodness of other things). Some things are good only for their consequences, and these lack unconditional goodness. Some things, in particular some traits of character, ‘are not only good in a number of aspects, but seem actually to constitute a part of the inner worth of the person’. Kant comments that the ancients esteemed them unconditionally; he does not reject this unconditional esteem. These goods lack unlimited goodness, because they become bad if they are not controlled by a good will (394). A good will, by contrast, does not become bad when it fails to achieve some good that we value from some non-moral point of view. The traditional doctrine that Kant endorses here treats the moral virtues as expressing a critical point of view on other goods. We need some basis for regulating our use of other goods, since we recognize that in some cases their unregulated use can lead to bad results. The point of view from which we recognize the bad results of bad use of other goods is the point of view from which we recognize the supreme principles of practical reason. The Platonic, Aristotelian, and Stoic tradition, accepted by Aquinas, takes this point of view to be our view of the ultimate end. Kant rejects this eudaemonist interpretation of the supreme principles of practical reason. We have already seen some of his reasons. Since his disagreement with the ancients about misuse actually points out a crucial area of agreement, we may fnid that he differs from traditional eudaemonism less than we might suppose from his explicit remarks. Since the goodness recognized in moral evaluation is not subordinate to any other sort of goodness, it is unconditionally good. It cannot depend on the actual achievement of results external to morality; for if it did depend on them, it would simply be another resource for acquiring further goods. Hence the goodness recognized from the moral point of view consists at least partly in moral virtue itself. As the ancient moralists claim, moral virtue is to be chosen for its own sake as a non-instrumental good that is not subordinate to other goods. Kant captures this point by claiming that the unlimited goodness recognized from the moral point of view consists in the good will.⁷ This goodness is an object of moral praise apart from its results. Once he has identified the will that is open to praise and blame from the moral point of view, Kant asks what makes it praiseworthy and blameworthy. Since wills differ from one another in their maxims, we need to find the maxim that makes one sort of agent morally praiseworthy.⁹ By treating the morally good will as an object of praise, Kant introduces the aspects of morality that make moral imperatives categorical. He implicitly distinguishes three different, but connected roles of morality (If we are related to morality in any one of these ways, must we be related to it in the other two ways as well? Not all benefciiaries of morality, and not all moral subjects, guide their actions by morality. Nor, apparently, need all benefciiaries be moral subjects; animals, children, or people with severe mental handicaps might be exceptions.¹⁰ Still, the three classes defnied by these three relations to morality overlap considerably. This overlap does not seem coincidental. Though we do not assume that we must ourselves benefti from every action required by morality, we do not assume that we are required to conform to morality and evaluated in the light of it, simply because other people find it convenient, apart from any reason of our own, to impose these requirements on us. We are inclined to assume that moral principles are those that every moral subject has a reason to accept. We assume that responsible agents are open to moral evaluation. If our assumption is right, every responsible agent has reason to be a moral agent. Kant believes that every rational agent has a reason to follow the principles that support justifeid praise and blame; the principles that a critic can reasonably apply are also those that an agent can reasonably follow. If Kant is right about this, and if a responsible agent is open to this sort of praise and blame, justifying reasons for accepting moral principles are good reasons for every responsible agent. If Kant is wrong, it seems unfair and arbitrary to blame an agent for violating moral principles. He needs to show that sort of goodness that is open to praise/blame consists in being guided by principles that all rational agents have reason to accept. ):
        - Persons are moral agents        - they guide their actions by moral principles. 
        - Persons are moral beneficiaries - their interests are considered in moral principles. 
        - Persons are moral subjects      - moral principles apply to them, and we evaluate their actions morally. 
    - We can see (without relying on the truth of our moral views) that moral principles are practical laws. It is more difficult to defend the second claim than to defend the first.
- Kant claims that from the moral point of view we praise those who act ‘from duty’: they do what is morally required because it is morally required, not because of some distinct inclination. They recognize what is morally required, and they believe that its being morally required is a suffciient reason for doing the action, no matter what else may be said for or against it. If they are right to believe this, morality gives us justifying reasons independent of non-moral aims and desires. 
- Kant distinguishes three types of people: 
    - those who do what is morally required, but for some purely instrumental reason; 
    - those who do what is morally required because of some direct inclination to the action that is (in fact) in accordance with duty; 
    - those who do what is morally required because it is morally required, and therefore act ‘from duty’ - Kant illustrates this point from a person who is not philanthropic by nature, but beneftis others because it is required by morality. Kant does not mean, however, that in someone who acts from duty the moral motive opposes all others. Opposition is a part of the experiment intended to reveal the distinctness of the moral motive; it is not a requirement for a morally good will. The heuristic role of the examples does not imply that the moral motive is always opposed to other motives.¹⁵ This account of acting from duty is meant to show we appropriately praise and blame moral agents quite generally, without restricting our praise and blame to a particular subset of rational agents. If Kant is right, the morally praiseworthy motive does not require any feeling or sentiment that might not belong to all rational agents. If Kant is right, the morally praiseworthy motive does not require any feeling or sentiment that might not belong to all rational agents. The justifying reasons provided by morality are not subordinate to reasons that have a non-moral source. Kant rejects Hume’s view that I have a justifying reason to do x if and only if I have a prior desire (independent of reasons for doing x) to do y, and doing x is a means to doing y. 
- According to Kant, the sentimentalist view reverses the proper connexion between moral reasons and moral sentiments. Sometimes the loss of a sentiment or inclination deprives me of all the reason I had; if, for instance, I lose my taste for jazz, I also lose my reason to buy jazz records. But someone who lacks the relevant sentiment in favour of morality has reason to acquire the sentiment, because he has reason to act morally.¹⁷ Similarly, someone who loses a pro-moral sentiment still has reason to act morally. It is diffciult, in any case, for sentimentalists to identify the appropriate pro-moral sentiment. They cannot say that it is the sentiment evoked by the conviction that we have moral reason to do this action. It must be a sentiment that is independent of such convictions, if it is to be the source of justifying reasons. Hutcheson suggests benevolence and the approval of benevolence. Hume suggests the sentiment of humanity. But it does not seem obvious that the action we think morally justified will also excite this sort of sentiment.¹⁸ Kant points out that sometimes the morally right action not only fails to excite our benevolence, but actually repels us, because our normal sympathetic feelings have been extinguished or diverted. He argues that these facts about our feelings do not cancel the moral obligation. We are therefore sometimes justified in praising and blaming people independently of the strength of their inclination to care about morality; we think our blame is appropriate for agents who lack pro-moral feelings. But if our blame is appropriate, then:
   - the agents must be responsible for their actions, and so capable of modifying them in the light of blame
   - there must be some good reason for them to modify their actions. Kant accepts the second claim because he believes that, contrary to Hume, justifeid praise and blame are different from expressions of our preferences or our invitations to other people to do what we would prefer them to do. If the blame is really justified, some principles make it reasonable for the agents themselves to agree with us about what they should do. 
- If my action is to express a moral principle, it has some specifc ipurpose; if we act from duty we give money (e.g.) in order to relieve someone’s need, not to enhance our own reputation. But in this case the moral principle we act on determines the purpose, not the other way round.
- Moral principles are therefore knowable a priori. Since they apply to rational agents as such, not to rational agents with some feature that is inessential to being a rational agent, they give justifying reasons to rational agents, irrespective of empirical features. For the same reasons, they are categorical imperatives; for they apply to rational agents, not to rational agents with some further inclination that gives them reason to accept moral principles.
- Our conception of moral praise and blame presupposes that moral reasons are based on practical laws. Moral praise and blame rest on the appropriate moral principles only if these moral principles are practical laws, giving reasons to rational agents as such, irrespective of the specific desires and inclinations of individuals.
- Moral Principles = Practical Laws = Categorical Imperatives
- Now, Kant did not show that moral catagorical imperatives exists. To prove that there are moral categorical imperatives, Kant needs to argue in three stages: 
    1) He should indicate what a moral categorical imperative will say, if there is any such thing. Hence he should find a plausible supreme principle of morality. 
    2) He should show that this principle is not simply a hypothetical imperative, because it does not give us a justifying reason by appeal to some antecedent non-moral preference. 
    3) He should show that it is a categorical imperative. For this purpose, it is not enough to show that it is not a hypothetical imperative; we must also have some reason to accept it independently of whatever else we happen to desire. This reason has to be equally good for every agent who is an appropriate object of justifeid praise and blame.²⁶ 
- To grasp the concept of a hypothetical imperative is not to grasp the specific principles that are hypothetical imperatives. In the case of the categorical imperative, however, Kant asks ‘whether perhaps the mere concept of a categorical imperative may not also supply us with the formula containing the proposition that can alone be a categorical imperative’ (G 420). His answer to this question is Yes; for consideration of the concept of a categorical imperative yields a statement of the one categorical imperative. Since the concept of a categorical imperative is the concept of a law for all rational agents, the one categorical imperative is the principle that requires acting in accord with a universal law for all rational agents.²⁷ This Formula of Universal Law, therefore, satisfies the concept of a categorical imperative. 
- According to Kant, the universal law ‘contains no condition to which it is limited’. He relies on his original claim that the good will is the only unlimited good.²⁸ It is good without limitation, because it expresses the moral point of view from which we see the limits on other goods; hence moral imperatives rest on reasons that are not limited by non-moral preferences. When Kant denies that the moral law is limited by any condition, he means that it does not depend on some agent’s having some particular antecedent preference giving her a specific purpose. Hence, any categorical imperative must rely on some reason that is independent of antecedent preferences. Since this reason is equally good for all rational agents, irrespective of their preferences, it is a universal law for all rational agents.
- Since Kant uses the concept of a categorical imperative to determine the goodness of an agent’s will, he must connect it with the agent’s maxim, and so with the reason that the agent acts on. Hence he formulates the categorical imperative with reference to a maxim: ‘Act only according to the maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law’ (G 421).³⁰ To decide whether a maxim ‘can’ be willed to be a universal law or ‘can’ become a universal law, Kant asks whether its becoming a universal law would involve some sort of contradiction. But the nature of the contradiction is not clear. Kant offers an example of deceitful promising. Someone moved by self-love acts on the maxim, ‘When I believe myself to be in need of money, I will borrow money and promise to repay it, although I know I shall never do so’. This maxim could not become a universal law, because the universalized maxim would involve a contradiction. If the maxim were treated as a universal law, everyone would know that everyone made promises on this assumption. Knowing this, people would be unwilling to accept promises; and so the whole practice of promising, on which the deceitful promisor relies, would collapse. Since the deceitful promisor’s maxim both presupposes promises and (if universalized) undermines promises, the universalized maxim contains a contradiction.³¹ This example suggests what Kant has in mind in speaking of a contradiction in willing. He does not intend a purely logical interpretation; for contradiction in willing does not require the acceptance of inconsistent propositions. It would be inconsistent to say both ‘I will make a promise’ and ‘No one will make a promise’, but it is consistent to make a promise on a maxim that would, if universalized, make it diffciult or impossible to make promises. Perhaps, then, Kant has in mind a practical contradiction; I will a particular action, but also will the existence of conditions that make it difficult to perform the action, so that my policy is self-defeating even if it is consistent. In that case, Kant might be describing the adoption of policies that would be self-defeating if they were universalized; he suggests that these are the ones that are morally unacceptable. This sort of contradiction, however, does not make a policy irrational, and so it does not seem obvious that the avoidance of such contradiction is a universal law for rational agents. Even if the universalization of my maxim would be self-defeating, the maxim need not be self-defeating. If it is most improbable that everyone will act on my maxim, why should I, as a rational agent, reject it? One might argue that Kant intends simply to propose a test of moral acceptability, so that a maxim is to be rejected if its universalization is self-defeating. He does not mean (on this view) that acting on the maxim is irrational in any further sense. This way of understanding Kant’s test faces two objections: (1) It is not clear why the avoidance of these morally unacceptable maxims is a categorical imperative, since it is not clear why all rational agents have a reason to avoid them. (2) It is not even clear that all policies that would be self-defeating if universalized are morally wrong. If I like to walk in a deserted place, the fact that it would not be deserted if other people knew about it does not make my current preference wrong. These objections ignore one feature of Kant’s example. If I walk where other people do not walk, I am (we may suppose) not taking any unfair advantage of them. But in making a promise I do not intend to keep, I take unfair advantage of people’s general willingness to keep rules that I do not want to keep. The fact that promise-breakers make an unjustifeid and unfair exception for themselves is exposed by the self-defeating character of the maxim when it is universalized. This answer may deal with some apparent counter-examples, but it does not vindicate Kant’s appeal to universal law and to contradiction. It shows that these tests will pick out some morally wrong actions only if we supplement them with some appeal to fairness. If the Formula of Universal Law includes the supplement, it is not obviously a categorical imperative; for it is not obvious that the supplement provides a reason for all rational agents as such. From a sentimentalist point of view, the supplement that introduces fairness shows that Kant needs to rely on some sentiment favouring fairness. In that case, the ‘contradiction in willing’ consists in a contradiction between the initial maxim and the universal principle plus the appropriate sentiment. The supposed categorical imperative collapses, therefore, into a hypothetical imperative: if we care about fairness, we cannot consistently accept the maxim allowing false promises. If this answer to Kant is right, he cannot derive a categorical imperative with the moral content that he wants. If the Formula of Universal Law could not be violated without inconsistent willing (‘Let there be promises and let there be no promises’), it would be a categorical imperative, but it would lack the appropriate moral content.³² Moral content apparently cannot be derived from rational agency alone, but must come from an empirical motive—in this case, from some sentiment favouring fairness. But even if we were to supplement Kant’s formula with a sentiment favouring fairness, we would not have found the supreme principle of morality. For some maxims are open to moral objection, even if they can be willed consistently with a sentiment of fairness. For instance, I can avoid taking unfair advantage of everyone else, if I forgo my own legitimate demands. If I do not care about being humiliated, then the universal law of humiliating people does not seem to introduce any contradiction into my willing, since it does not seem to involve any conflict with fairness. And so either the Formula of Universal Law is open to cogent objections, or we should interpret it differently. Kant offers an interpretation of his formula that responds to these objections. He examines a maxim that neither defeats itself when universalized nor takes unfair advantage of other people, but still—in his view—violates the Formula of Universal Law. He considers a ‘maxim of independence’—the maxim of someone who does not want to help other people. Kant argues that this maxim is unacceptable, because we ‘cannot will’ its universalization, which leaves everyone free to refuse to help others if they feel like refusing.³³ 
- What does Kant mean by saying that we ‘cannot will’ the universalization of the maxim of independence? He admits that the universal law of independence is consistent; it is not self-defeating in the way that a universal law of deceitful promises would be. Nor does the universal law of independence seem to confilct with the desires of all actual people. Even if we cannot give up wanting other people to help us, we might surely want their help less than we want other things, so that we could consistently accept a universal law of independence. And even if a universal law of independence were psychologically impossible for actual people, this would not help Kant in the search for a categorical imperative that gives a reason to all rational agents. Nor does Kant appeal to self-centred egoistic calculation of one’s own interest. Even if he appealed to the effect of the universalized maxim on my hypothetical interests (i.e., those I would have in the situation where the maxim would be universally accepted), the outlook of the Formula would not be egoistic. From a self-centred point of view, I have no reason to be concerned with hypothetical consequences for my interest unless these are also likely. If I consider the impact of a universal law on everyone’s interest, I am not concerned simply with my own interest. Nor does Kant consider total utility. He does not ask whether the total consequences of the universal law of independence would be worse than the consequences of some other universal law. He simply asks us to consider whether we ‘can will’ the universal law. 
- Kant claims that we ‘cannot will’ the universal law of laziness.³⁴ He argues that, as rational beings, we necessarily will the development of our talents. By this he does not mean that all actual rational beings want to develop their talents. He means that refusal to develop talents refelcts an empirical preference that would be rejected by a rational agent who is guided by the outlook of rational agents as such.
- In rejecting the maxims of independence and laziness, Kant distinguishes his categorical imperative from the Golden Rule. We might have thought that the Formula of Universal Law, in the example of false promising, expresses the Golden Rule, prohibiting us from endorsing actions that we would not want to allow other people to do to us. Kant, however, dismisses the Golden Rule as ‘trivial’.³⁵ In distinguishing his principle from the Golden Rule, he denies that fairness of the sort that is consistent with the maxims of independence and laziness adequately captures the categorical imperative. When he asks what someone ‘can will’ or what ‘can be’ a universal law, he answers from the point of view of a rational agent as such. Though particular rational agents may put up with all sorts of universal laws, only some of these are laws that rational agents, as such, can will.
- Any practical law must be a law for all rational agents as such; and so any maxim that conforms to a practical law must be a maxim that we can will, from the point of view of rational agents as such, to be a universal law.
- To explain the Formula of Universal Law, Kant introduces a second formula of the categorical imperative, the ‘Formula of Humanity’, which requires us to treat persons as ends in themselves. He reaches the conception of an end in itself by introducing the idea of an objective end that is an end for all rational agents. The only objective end is humanity. Hence the only categorical imperative is the one that prescribes treatment of persons as objective ends, and hence as ends in themselves. Kant re-examines the examples that illustrate the Formula of Universal Law, and argues that in each case the prohibited maxim violates the Formula of Humanity, because it treats people as means to some further end, and not as ends in themselves. Kant re-examines the examples that illustrate the Formula of Universal Law, and argues that in each case the prohibited maxim violates the Formula of Humanity, because it treats people as means to some further end, and not as ends in themselves (G 429). Suicide just for the sake of avoiding distress undervalues the rational aspect of persons, and treats them purely as subjects of pleasure and pain. The categorical imperative goes beyond mere reciprocity and so excludes the rejection of mutual aid (in the third example). It is not simply the Golden Rule (G 430n). Since rational beings want concern for rational beings to be reciprocated, they reject complete subordination of rational beings to one person’s interests.³⁸  In Kant’s treatment of the third and fourth examples, the Formula of Humanity is needed to explicate the previous formulae. If the previous formulae (Universal Law and Law of Nature) prescribe merely consistent willing, they do not exclude maxims that Kant wants to exclude.³⁹ If, however, the categorical imperative requires non-instrumental concern for the interests and aims of rational beings in their own right, it excludes consistent policies that subordinate the interests and aims of some rational beings to the subjective ends of anyone. The Formula of Humanity expresses this aspect of the categorical imperative. In the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant uses this formula to explain duties to oneself and others; it demands respect both for one’s own humanity and for the humanity of others.⁴⁰ 
- Kant argues that if moral principles express a categorical imperative, they must rest on an objective end. As we have seen, his separation of objective from subjective ends separates those ends that give reasons only on the basis of an antecedent desire from the ends that give reasons independent of desires. But this minimal conception of an objective end does not yet show that objective ends must be ends for all rational agents as such.⁴² Without some rather controversial assumptions about the nature of ends, the independence of an end from antecedent inclination is only a necessary condition for being suitable for all rational agents as such. Kant wants to show that the objective end relevant to morality is an end for all rational agents as such. The objective end for rational beings must impose a limit on the pursuit of subjective ends. Kant might intend either of two claims (An objective end for all rational agents imposes both kinds of limit on the pursuit of subjective ends. It is ‘the supreme limiting condition of every man’s freedom of action’ (G 431). It provides a ‘supreme practical principle’ (428), so that its demands specify the legitimate degree of satisfaction of our other ends. Returning to his initial contrast between the unlimited goodness of the good will and the limited goodness of other goods, Kant claims that the unlimited goodness prescribes the limits for the pursuit of the limited goods): 
    - The objective end is a source of value distinct from the inclination-dependent value of subjective ends. Since, therefore, it claims some of our attention, it claims to limit the attention we give to subjective ends. 
    - It claims priority over subjective ends; its demands come before the demands
- If all value were the result of antecedent desire, and hence of subjective ends, there would be no supreme practical principle (according to Kant) for reason. If there is such a principle, something must be an end in itself. This end is an object of respect, not appraised simply from the point of view of our inclinations. 
- An objective end is an object of respect, not an end to be achieved. This apparently paradoxical claim is intelligible if we consider different influences on goal-directed action. We may speak in general of the end of our action as the state of affairs whose properties guide us in choosing what to do. The end we seek to achieve obviously satisfies this description; if we want to achieve an end that includes having a wall painted red, we try to get red paint. Things that are not ends we aim to achieve may also guide our choices. Suppose we want to renovate a building, while preserving its original character. The character of the building—the height of the ceilings, the size of the rooms, and so on—constrains the changes we can make in the course of renovation. The original character is not something we try to achieve, since it is already there. But we respect it, if we attribute to it some value that determines the permissible ends we try to achieve and the means we adopt. It is part of the total end that we seek to achieve, since we do not achieve our aims unless we respect the original character of the building; but it is not itself something that we achieve. This example may suggest how morality requires an objective end. The example is not perfectly analogous; for the end that is an object of respect in relation to our plans for renovation may result from inclination. Kant requires an objective end that is an object of respect in relation to every end resulting from inclination. For morality evaluates and criticizes preference-based reasons. It gives us good reasons to act, independently of any antecedent preferences or feelings; these reasons tell us which of our antecedent preferences and feelings we can legitimately act on. Since the objective end has this limiting function, Kant calls it a ‘supreme limiting condition on the pursuit of subjective ends’
- In our conception of a good will we distinguish two kinds of end: 
    - End to be achieved (ein zu bewirkender Zweck)
    - Self-suffciient aka independent end (selbsta¨ndiger Zweck) - We abstract from every end to be achieved, and we are left with an independent end. The only independent end is ‘the subject of all possible ends themselves, because this at the same time is the subject of a possible absolutely good will; for this sort of will cannot without contradiction be subordinated to any other object (Gegenstand)’ (G 437). The subject of all possible ends is a person, who is not merely a means to be arbitrarily used (zum beliebigen Gebrauche) for this or that will (Wille) (G 428). Since persons are not to be used simply as means, they ‘limit all choice’ (alle Willku¨r einschra¨nkt)⁴³ by considerations about rational beings. This objective end for all rational agents is not simply a rival to subjective ends; it also prescribes the legitimate extent of their pursuit. Kant believes he has found the right sort of end by identifying rational agents as objective ends and ends in themselves; their rational agency includes a limit on the pursuit of subjective ends.
- Kant’s argument is rather brief and elliptical. It sets out from the value we attach to a good will apart from its results, and concludes that we treat a rational agent as an objective end. A fuller statement of his argument might be this: 
    1. Suppose that we did not value the rational will as an end in itself, deserving respect in its own right apart from any result it tends to achieve. 
    2. In that case, we would value it in relation to some end to be achieved. 
    3. In that case, it would have purely instrumental value, and we would have no reason to value it in circumstances where it was ineffective. 
    4. But we have reason to value the good will irrespective of whether or not it is effective - Kant appeals (in (4)) to the fact that we value the good will in itself, apart from its instrumental value; he infers that we regard the rational will as an end in itself. Why does his claim about the good will support his claim about the rational will? The answer depends on Kant’s account of what we value in a good will. If a good will were distinct from a rational will, respect for a good will would not imply respect for a rational will, even if only rational wills could be good wills. Kant argues, however, that the good will is good because it responds to the reasons that are good reasons for every rational agent as such, irrespective of any particular empirical inclinations. Hence the good will is a rational will functioning purely as such; and hence, if the rational will being thoroughly rational deserves respect, the rational will itself deserves respect. 
    5. So we must regard it as an end in itself — something that we respect as a limit on the pursuit of other ends. 
- Different argument for the same conclusion sets out from the premiss that we recognize a categorical imperative, and proceeds as follows: 
    1. To accept a categorical imperative is to be guided by a principle appealing to rational agents as such, over principles that appeal to subjective ends.
    2. To be guided by a principle appealing to rational agents as such is to give practical priority to rational agency over subjective ends, so that we act on the requirements of rational agency before fulfliling the demands of any subjective ends - Kant means that when we commit ourselves to a categorical imperative, we accept the claims of rational agency over the claims of subjective ends; the prior considerations are those that matter from the point of view of rational agency, not from the point of view of this or that particular rational agent. It is reasonable to recognize this priority if and only if we value acting on the claims of rational agency over the claims of subjective ends. If we take this attitude, we imply that rational agents, as such, are not subordinate to any subjective end. 
    3. In giving such priority to rational agency, we treat rational agency as an objective end. 
    4. Hence, in accepting a categorical imperative, we treat rational agents, as such, as objective ends, that is, as ends in themselves.⁴⁴ 
- We may express this point in Kantian terms by complicating our previous description of the maxim of one’s action. If I swim just for enjoyment, we might say that my maxim is ‘I’m doing something I enjoy’ or ‘I’m doing it because I enjoy it’, and that it is a morally acceptable maxim; surely there is nothing wrong with swimming just for fun? In Kant’s view, however, this is not the maxim of a person with a good will, since it is not a morally acceptable maxim. If we act on an acceptable maxim, we are responsive to possible moral objections, even if the objections do not arise in this particular case. These moral conditions must be presupposed as the background in which a morally good agent pursues enjoyment. Hence a subjective end alone does not yield a morally acceptable maxim. Hence the maxim that they could will to be a universal law is not (e.g.) ‘Do what you enjoy’, but ‘Do what you enjoy in the right circumstances’, where the right circumstances are those in which no moral objection arises. ToexpressKant’spointaboutsubjectiveends,wemightsaythatanacceptablemaximmust include, or implicitly refer to, conditions that would justify the particular action. The relevant justification includes satisfactory answers to the questions that can be asked about the effects of x on rational agents. Given this conception of a maxim, it follows that if we can justify this action only by reference to some subjective end, our maxim is morally unacceptable. 
- Later remarks suggest that we treat ourselves as ends in so far as we set ends for ourselves.⁴⁵ Setting ends for oneself is a distinguishing mark of a rational agent, and it somehow commits us to regarding ourselves as ends. What is the connexion? If setting ends for oneself is distinctive of rational agents, it is not simply pursuing an end, or aiming at an end, since non-rational animals can do that. ‘Setting ends’ should refer to some rational and deliberate act of choosing an end; this act is peculiar to rational choosers. To set an end for myself, therefore, is not the same as pursuing an end. It differs in two respects: 
    - I set an end and do not simply pursue it - Rational agents who set ends do not act on arbitrary choices. According to Aquinas, rational agents grasp ‘the character of the end’ (ratio finis);⁴⁶ they see what is good about this end in relation to the other ends that they see reason to pursue. If Kant has something similar in mind, he is right to claim that setting an end requires a distinctively rational capacity.
    - I set it for myself -  His second condition, that one sets the end for oneself, also seems to follow Aquinas. In Aquinas’ view, we choose ends as goods in relation to the ultimate good for ourselves. Kant seems to agree that when I set an end as an end for myself, I choose it with myself in mind. To have myself in mind in choosing an end is to rely on some conception of myself and my other ends. A particular end deserves to be chosen not simply because I fnid it appealing in its own right, but because it fits appropriately with my conception of myself and my other ends. I do not want to pursue any particular end to a degree that conflicts with the structure of ends that I attribute to myself; and so I attach greater value to myself than I do to any single end just as such. Kant seems to intend the same conception of choice by a rational agent, when he introduces the duty to aim at one’s own perfection.⁴⁷ If I am a rational agent, I propose an end with myself in mind, and hence in the light of some conception of myself. If I regard myself as a limit on the pursuit of other ends, I rely on a conception of myself that I value as a guide to the choice of other ends. If I value myself, I must also (Kant assumes) value my abilities, and hence seek to realize them. Hence the capacity to set ends for myself supports the demand for cultivation of one’s talents. This argument for development of one’s capacities as a rational agent recalls still another aspect of Aquinas’ description of rational agency. In Aquinas’ view, our pursuit of happiness includes a desire for perfection.⁴⁸ He refers to perfection to make it clear that the rational pursuit of one’s final good does not simply involve the adjustment of some of our desires to others, but also requires some conception of the aspects of oneself that are worth realizing. This conception is one’s idea of perfection. Kant agrees; for he believes that setting ends for oneself implies valuing oneself as a rational agent, and hence valuing one’s rational agency and its development. Given this conception of setting an end for oneself, Kant believes that rational agency implies treating oneself, as a rational agent, as an end in itself. Kant does not imply that my simple choice makes one end more valuable than another, so that the value of particular ends is entirely the product of choice. On the contrary, the reference to choosing ‘for myself’ suggests that it is the character of my self that determines whether one or another choice is correct. My grounds for pursuing one or another end to this or that degree rest partly on its being an end for me; the traits, characteristics, and ends that constitute me are a condition that limits the pursuit of this end. Hence rational agents necessarily regard themselves individually as ends. We can therefore defend Kant’s claims about treating oneself as an end by refelxion on the character of prudential thought in a rational agent.
- In moral choice, one treats oneself as an end not only in relation to one’s own desires, but also in relation to other people’s. This treatment refelcts an individual’s self-respect—a demand for non-instrumental consideration by other people. Such a demand is supported by one’s attitude to oneself in relation to one’s particular passions. In both cases, I value myself above any particular end to be achieved, and I attach this value to myself as a rational agent. It would be unreasonable to suppose that I am a limiting condition for my own subjective ends, but not for other people’s subjective ends; why should the mere fact that they are other people’s ends rather than mine make it reasonable for me to subordinate myself to them? Kant argues that respect for myself as a rational agent also commits me to respect for rational agents, and hence commits me to the treatment of rational agents as ends in themselves. 
- He now suggests that the simple capacity to set ends for themselves does not make them ends in themselves; this status comes only from their morally practical reason.⁴⁹ Here Kant seems to contradict his account in the Groundwork of the sources of human dignity. In other places, too, he distinguishes humanity from personality, claiming that the moral law reveals personality as something that ‘elevates man above himself as a part of the world of sense’ (KpV 86). The demand for persons to be treated as ends in themselves ‘rests on the personality of these beings, whereby alone they are ends in themselves’. Kant contrasts man as phenomenon and man as noumenon, and suggests that personality belongs to the noumenal self, in contrast to the mere humanity that makes us capable of setting ends.
- Later, Kant distinguishes humanity from personality by alluding to different roles of practical reason. His allusions reveal some of the obscurity that we have previously noticed in his discussions of practical reason, prudence, and morality. He alludes to four functions of practical reason (It is not clear, however, how Kant takes these four functions to be related. Does he, for instance, take the maximizing function to be an instance of the instrumental function of practical reason? This question takes us back to an obscurity that we noticed in his treatment of the hypothetical imperative. In speaking of the rationality of maximizing, we might have two different claims in mind: (a) Given that I want to maximize the satisfaction of my inclinations, it is rational for me to find ways to do it. (b) It is rational for me to find ways to maximize the satisfaction of my inclinations. The two claims have different implications if I happen not to care about maximizing the satisfaction of my inclinations. The first claim implies that I have no reason to find ways to maximize, but the second claim implies that it is still rational for me to maximize, even though I do not care about it. If practical reason aims at maximization irrespective of my inclinations about it, it is not purely instrumental to inclination. Hence the second function of practical reason does not seem to be simply an instance of the first function): 
    -It is purely instrumental, finding means to a end given by inclination. 
    - It aims at maximization, at what satisfeis the ‘greatest sum’ of inclinations. 
    - It prescribes ends without reliance on inclination - Kant is equally obscure about the relation between the third and the fourth functions. His only example of the third function is moral practical reason. Does he believe, therefore, that this is the only case in which practical reason can present ends independently of inclinations? It would not be surprising if he believed this, given his assumption that prudence is not a source of categorical imperatives. But if he had been clearer about the difference between the first and the second functions of practical reason, he could not so easily have assumed that the only non-instrumental function is found in morality. 
    - In the moral law, it guides us independently of any other incentive.
- Does he believe that the non-instrumental role of practical reason is the source of dignity in its own right? Or is moral reason the source of dignity, and does Kant treat non-instrumental practical reason as the source of dignity only because it coincides with moral reason? He has good reason to take non-instrumental practical reason itself to be the source of dignity. For he connects morality with a categorical imperative that appeals to rational agents as such. If our attitude to moral practical reason includes an element that cannot be justifeid by appeal to rational agency as such, he defeats his argument about morality. If dignity belongs to moral agents for some reason unconnected with rational agency, moral imperatives do not seem to be categorical imperatives. If, then, Kant attributes dignity exclusively to moral agency, he faces this damaging consequence. He ought to take practical reason itself to be the source of dignity, so that moral agency is a source of dignity because it is rational agency.
- If I respect myself as a rational agent, I have some concern for the rational aims I form in my own interest; even though I could be a rational agent without these particular aims, they are valuable for me as a rational agent partly because I have chosen them. Hence if we value a person’s rational agency, we ought to regard a person’s rational aims and interests as themselves deserving respect, not to be exploited in someone else’s interest. If we see grounds for respecting persons as rational agents, we ought also to respect their interests, and refuse to subordinate their interests to other people’s interests. This connexion between respect for persons as ends and concern for the interests of persons is the source of moral content in the Formula of Humanity.
- Morality is concerned with the interests of persons, and especially with the impact of actions, states of character, and so on, on the interests of persons. If we conceive these interests as simply the satisfaction of inclinations, apart from their relation to the person whose interests they are, we will endorse a utilitarian conception of the morally appropriate end, and suppose that we promote a person’s interest by satisfying inclinations. Kant, however, believes that rational agents care about their own interest because they are agents with a specific identity and specific aims apart from any particular collection of inclinations. The agents who have the aims deserve respect not the aims themselves. This account of interests and respect gives us a further reason to believe that Kant takes rational agency itself, rather than moral goodness, to be the source of dignity. If the only aspect of rational agents that has dignity is their moral goodness, why should respect for this require respect for their interests? Could I not recognize that A is a morally good person and deserves respect for her moral goodness, without supposing that A deserves any particular attention to her aims and interests? In Kant’s view, the respect we owe to a person requires some respect for her aims and interests. If I ascribe dignity to myself, I expect to have my own interests, not simply my moral aims, considered for my sake. That is why he advises: ‘Be no man’s lackey.—Do not let others tread with impunity on your rights’ (MdS 436).⁵² 
- If we exclude it altogether from our understanding of Kant’s principles, we exclude not only empirical elements, but teleological elements in general, from basic moral principles. Kant does not exclude teleology, however. He relies on it in his interpretation of the formulae of the categorical imperative. The Formula of the Law of Nature speaks of a system of nature in which different actions and agents fulfl ithe ends appropriate for them. Consideration of which maxims we can will to be universal laws requires us to refer to the needs of the people involved.⁵³ Kant rejects a conception of the good that is entirely independent of morality, but he accepts a conception that is appropriately infulenced by moral considerations.⁵⁴ To respect people as ends is to consider their interests appropriately.
- As Kant promised, the Formula of Humanity helps to explain the Formula of Universal Law. In particular, it explains what is meant in speaking of what one can or cannot will as a rational being. One wills as a rational being on the basis of justifying reasons that apply to rational agents as such. Kant argues that any such reasons treat rational agents as ends. If, then, there is a categorical imperative, it prescribes treatment of rational agents as ends. This argument does not prove that there is a categorical imperative; for the reasons we take to be valid for rational agents as such may not really be valid for them. The moral point of view asserts the validity of these reasons; but to show that these reasons are valid, we need some further argument that does not simply take the moral point of view for granted. The further argument comes from the connexion between morality and freedom. 








# Difficulties

- Butler, Reid, and Sidgwick say that the rational pursuit of happiness gives us the reason that impartial justice is even more rational that pursuit of happiness. In trying to maintain the rationality of the affection for justice without allowing the rationality of the desire for happ
iness, Kant weakens his case for the supremacy of justice.
- The non-eudaemonist intellectualist interpretationofScotusanticipatesaKantianargumentforconnectingfreedomwithpractical reason. This argument raises difficulties for Kant that are parallel to some of the difficulties that we have found in trying to make room for Scotus’ voluntarism. Both Scotus and Kant may be better off with a more intellectualist conception of freedom than the one that they tend to accept. 
- Kant departs further than Butler departs from Aristotelian eudaemonism, since he rejects the naturalist account of virtue and the harmony of self-love and conscience. 
- Voluntarism is one element in the Kantian conception of the will. But Kant does not give up the connexion between the will and practical reason. The voluntarist aspects of his position conflict with the intellectualist aspects. He returns to Scotus’ belief that the affection for justice is somehow constitutive of, not simply one possible manifestation of, the freedom of the will; and so some of the objections to Scotus seem to fit Kant as well.
- The question draws attention to an important aspect of eudaemonism. We might wrongly take a eudaemonist to rely on an empirical, though universal, feature of human beings, that they desire happiness. This is how Kant interprets the desire for happiness.
- Kant's case against happiness does not apply directly to the traditional conception of happiness, as we find it in Aristotle and Aquinas. For they do not take happiness to consist simply in pleasure; hence Kant’s arguments that rest on claims about pleasure do not show that happiness cannot be the source of practical laws. 
- Is Kant right to claim that the highest good, as the ancients understand it, can yield only hypothetical imperatives? Let us suppose for the moment that the ancients regard the highest good egoistically, as one’s own good. In claiming that this yields only hypothetical imperatives, Kant denies that there are any categorical imperatives of prudence. His denial rests on the assumption that one’s good is happiness (as Kant understands it), or some other object of inclination. In that case, one’s own good is not an ‘objective determining ground’ that one has a reason to pursue apart from the strength of one’s own desire. We might, however, doubt Kant’s assumptions. One’s own good does not seem to provide only internal reasons based on antecedent inclination. We seem to have reason to pursue our own good even if we do not care enough about it; if I stop wanting to be healthy, I do not make it unreasonable to care about it; rather, I cease to want what it is still reasonable for me to want. My own good, therefore, ftis Kant’s conception of an objective end. Kant’s rejection of this conclusion relies on his questionable views about external reasons of prudence. 
- he tries to undermine our intuitive belief in prudential categorical imperatives. If he succeeded, he would cast doubt on the possibility of external justifying reasons. Such doubts would spread to moral imperatives. For he relies on the intuitive judgment that rational agents are sometimes open to moral criticism, however their inclinations may vary. IfKant arguesinthisway,hecannot fairly ignoreparallelargumentsforexternalprudential reasons. There must be some external reasons, if there are practical laws. If there are no practical laws, Kant’s whole argument collapses, and there are no categorical imperatives of morality. Hence, his objection to external prudential reasons ought to be more specific than a general Humean objection to external reasons. We might defend Kant by arguing that moral reasons are external, whereas prudential reasons are purely internal and dependent on the agent’s desires. But what would explain this difference between prudence and morality? Belief in external prudential reasons rests on claims about our nature and what is suitable for it. If Kant, following Hume, denies that such claims support external reasons, he undermines his claims about categorical imperatives, which apply to rational agents because they are rational agents, not because of some further desire. Doubts about prudential external reasons, therefore, seem to spread to moral external reasons. Since Kant accepts moral external reasons, he ought to accept prudential external reasons. 
- We might doubt the claim of traditional eudaemonism to rely on truths about rational agents as such, if we doubt whether there are any suffciiently determinate truths. Kant, however, does not share this general doubt, since he believes that truths about rational agents as such support practical laws in morality. He assumes that the case for prudential practical laws is weaker than the case for moral practical laws. His assumption is open to question. The best defence of his objections to prudential practical laws appeals to general Humean doubts about external reasons. If we do not share these doubts, it is difficult to reject prudential laws. But if we share Humean doubts about external reasons, we undermine Kant’s case for moral practical laws. 
- Kant’s inference about categorical imperatives is open to question, for reasons we have already noticed. If we allow external reasons that do not depend on an agent’s preference, we may recognize such reasons that depend on special features of particular agents, apart from their desires. Kant overlooks the possibility of imperatives based on such reasons. To support his conclusion about moral reasons, we must add the further premiss that moral reasons do not depend on peculiarities of some rational agents as opposed to others, any more than they depend on the preferences of particular rational agents. The arguments he offers for the universality of moral reasons support this further premiss.
