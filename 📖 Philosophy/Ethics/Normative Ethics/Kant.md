- Kant uses a counterfactual argument somewhat similar to Plato’s to argue that agents lack a good will and that their actions lack moral worth if they choose to do what duty requires for the sake of its good consequences. He concludes that we have a good will only if we choose ‘duty for duty’s sake’, so that we choose what is morally required precisely because it is morally required and not because of some further aspect of it that is not essential to its being morally required
- Rejects the supremacy of reasons based on one’s own good for being moral
- Non-eudamonism moralism is true: happiness is not needed for a sufficient justification of virtue.
- Against sentimrntalism, Kant argues that rational agents deserve respect from others, irrespective of anyone’s sympathies.
- We might even agree that virtue requires the choice of the right action for the right reason, looking to the very fact that makes the action right. This demand might be understood, as Kant understands it, non-teleologically, so that it does not refer to any connexion between virtuous action and one’s ultimate end.
- Apart from our moral beliefs, we have no reason to attribute freedom to human beings
- Kant’s contrast between acting on duty and acting on other motives: The two people he contrasts with the person acting out of duty are the trader who does the honest thing for the sake of his business and the philanthropist who acts out of his generous sentiments. The action of the philanthropist lacks moral worth not because it is selfish, but because his reason for doing the generous action rests ultimately on his generous impulses; if he lacked them, he would have lost his reason for these actions. Kant is primarily concerned with the distinction that Aquinas draws in his account of intellectual love.
- Pufendorf, then, seems to be open to the objections that Cudworth raises against Hobbes. Kant summarizes these objections in claiming that positive law presupposes natural law.⁴⁶ We might not agree with Kant’s claim that the ground of the authority of a legislator of positive law must be moral, and therefore must be part of natural law. But his claim is plausible if we consider a legislative theory of the natural moral law itself; the non-moral grounds that Pufendorf offers do not vindicate the authority of a moral legislator. Hence at least one natural law cannot itself be valid simply because it has been legislated by a divine legislator. This is why Kant, while conceding that we may call God a legislator, denies that God is the author of the moral law.
- Kant describes the pursuit of one’s own perfection and the happiness of others as duties of virtue, as opposed to right. His division between duties of virtue and of right seems to affirm a division that Leibniz rejects. 
- Butler believes Clarke goes too far in rejecting naturalism; the restoration of some aspects of traditional naturalism is Butler’s answer to sentimentalism. Kant’s objections to rationalism are similar to Butler’s in some important ways that are not completely obvious. Once we see these similarities, we can more easily see the ways in which Kant’s answers to the objections do and do not differ from Butler’s return to traditional naturalism. 
- A variation of Hutcheson’s constructivism might substitute a rational procedure for the reactions of the moral sense. This is approximately the form of constructivism favoured by Kant, according to some views of his position
- Balfour relies on the Socratic and Stoic view (later exploited by Kant) that virtue consists in the good use of other goods;
- considerations suggest that rational intuition of independent sui generis facts is not a satisfactory conclusion for a rationalist to reach. If we find the rationalist position unsatisfactory, we may react in different ways: 
    - We may decide that sentimentalism is right after all.
    - We may decide that the appeal to independent facts is mistaken. This question is connected with a question about the nature of Kant’s rejection of rational intuition; does this lead him to a version of the second reaction as well as the third? Some of his views encourage interpreters to believe that his rejection of rationalism includes the rejection of objectivism. We need to see whether this is Kant’s position, and whether he has a good reason for regarding it as the most reasonable reaction to the intuitionist aspects of rationalism.
    - We may decide that the separation of moral truths from truths about rational agents is mistaken. Kant is dissatisfied both with empiricism and with the rationalism that leads to undefended intuitions. Part of his strategy can be described as an expression of the third reaction; for he takes the connexion between a theory of rational agency and a theory of morality to be much tighter than it appears to be in rationalist conceptions. To this extent he develops a central aspect of Butler’s position (despite his ignorance of Butler) that is obscured by Price and Reid (despite their knowledge of Butler).
Still, Kant does not revive mediaeval naturalism; he rejects it even more clearly than the rationalists do. His rejection is implicit; he does not seriously consider the Aristotelian position defended by Aquinas and his 16th-century supporters, and his explicit references to Greek ethics are rather brief and inexact. We will have to examine his reasons for rejecting the naturalist position, and see how far they leave him from the position common to Aquinas and Butler.
- Kant’s attitude to rationalist intuitionism and sentimentalism in ethics may be compared with his attitude to rationalism and empiricism in metaphysics and epistemology:
    - In the First Critique, he agrees with rationalists against empiricists in believing that there are true non-empirical principles in addition to the truths grasped by experience. But he does not simply assert that these are innate principles, or that they are grasped by rational intuition (Kant criticizes innatism at KrV B167–8). He argues that they are true and non-empirical. In his view, we must recognize their truth and their non-empirical character if we admit any empirical knowledge, or even admit some basic truths about self-consciousness. If he is right, we must reject empiricism if we believe some elementary truths that an empiricist must believe. Kant tries to do something similar in his moral philosophy. He wants to display the rational necessity of the moral point of view, to those who accept moral judgments, or even any plausible conception of rational agency. 
- He argues, therefore, in two different directions (These two different directions of argument should agree in their conclusions. On the one hand, the kind of agent who is presupposed by morality ought to be one whom we can reasonably believe to exist. On the other hand, the principles that a rational agent has reason to accept ought to include recognizably moral principles):
    - ‘regressive’ (or ‘analytic’) - argues from common-sense convictions about morality and moral reasons, to an account of the sort of agent and the sort of will that can be moved by such reasons. Problem 1 is: Granted something about morality, find the sort of will that is determined by it alone.
    - ‘progressive’ (or ‘synthetic’) - The progressive method begins from claims about rational agency — the sorts of agents that we take ourselves to be, and the sorts of reasons that concern us. It argues from these claims to an account of the practical principles that we have reason to accept. Problem 2 is: Granted a free will, find the law that alone is competent to determine it necessarily. 
- The two central concepts that Kant relies on are those of morality and of freedom, which he connects closely with rational agency. Through the moral law we discover the principles that move a will if there is any free will; but we still need some further argument to show that the kind of free will postulated by the moral law is possible.³ 
- We might reasonably compare Kant’s two directions of argument with those that Aristotle distinguishes - one begins from what is ‘more knowable to us’ and proceeds towards the principles that are ‘more knowable by nature’:
    - The principles are ‘more knowable by nature’ because they capture the real explanatory and justifciatory relations between the ordinary convictions we begin with and the less accessible truths that underlie these convictions. A progressive argument setting out from the principles known ‘by nature’ ought not to take the truth of our moral convictions for granted, but ought to justify our conviction of their truth by further principles. In the First Critique, Kant distinguishes a question of fact from a question of right (quid iuris), and takes the second question to require an answer giving a ‘deduction’ that constitutes a justification.⁵ Similar questions seem to be relevant to morality. We find an ‘apparent contradiction between the mechanism of nature and freedom’ (KpV 97). If we could go no further, we would have to conclude that our moral convictions lead us to believe something that we have good reason to reject.
- In Kant’s view, however, the conception of freedom we reach through morality is also reasonable in its own right, and therefore supports the rationality of our moral beliefs. To this extent he offers a ‘deduction’ for practical reason. He claims that our moral beliefs are the foundation of our belief in freedom, and our belief in freedom is the foundation of our moral beliefs. These two claims are consistent, and indeed support each other, if they refer to different types of foundation.
- It seems that Kant did not know about Butler, Balguy and Price.
- Kant knew about Hutcheson, Leibnitz and Wolff
- Kant may knew about Aristotle, Seneca, Cicero and Cudworth.
- To grasp the extent of Kant’s disagreement with sentimentalists, we need to consider whether he rejects their account of practical reason and motivation in general, or only their account of moral reason and motivation.
- If Kant rejects both the ungrounded intuitions of Clarke and Price and the mutability resulting from sentimentalism, we might expect him to consider the position that we have called ‘traditional naturalism’:
    -  Kant returns, in one respect, to traditional naturalism - He rejects the immediacy of rightness, as Clarke tries to explain it. In his view, right action is fitting for a rational agent; we cannot see the rightness of an action by inspecting the action in itself, but we must see it in relation to the rational agent who does the action. In recognizing this relational and contextual aspect of rightness, Kant is closer to Butler and to Suarez than to Clarke. 
    - On another point, however, he abandons naturalism - He argues that we cannot explain or defend morality through an account of human nature; naturalism tries to rest morality on ‘anthropology’. His explicit objections, however, are not aimed directly at traditional naturalism, but at Humean naturalism. He does not discuss the normative version of naturalism that the Greek moralists, Aquinas, and Butler all accept. Perhaps he agrees with Wollaston and Hume who, despite their sharp disagreements on the nature of morality, agree that a normative conception of nature has no role in an account of morality.
    - Whatever Kant says, it is not always clear that he rejects normative naturalism. Sometimes he simply seems to replace fitness to rational nature with fitness to rational beings. He seems to disagree, therefore, with traditional naturalism only in denying that the rational aspect of rational beings is a feature of their nature. We may wonder whether he is entitled to draw the line between the natural and the non-natural where he does.
- Kant’s conception of the basis of our moral knowledge raises a question about whether he means to defend objectivity or to replace it. He argues that we have a priori knowledge of moral properties; our knowledge rests on necessary features of rational and moral agents. We might say (perhaps exaggerating the parallel with the First Critique) that some moral facts are necessary for the possibility of our experience of ourselves as moral agents.¹⁶ But then we might ask whether these necessary features of our experience tell us about objective moral facts, or simply about our experience. The question about Kant’s realism or anti-realism in the First Critique returns when we consider his practical philosophy.  This comparison with the First Critique needs to consider the differences that Kant sees between theoretical and practical philosophy. Since moral beliefs are not suitably connected to our empirical knowledge, they cannot be about appearances; hence, if they are true about anything, they must be true about things in themselves. But in that case must they not give us knowledge of things in themselves, contrary to the First Critique? Our views about the meta-ethical implications of Kant’s views depend on specific claims about his ethical arguments, and on more general claims about the connexion between his practical philosophy and the rest of his philosophical position. Some of the main interpretative issues can best be decided when we have discussed Kant’s views on freedom. 
- Kant agrees with Butler, Price, and Reid in accepting a rationalist account of the nature and basis of morality, even though he does not rely on intuitionism to support rationalism. He agrees with their view that rationalism conflicts with utilitarianism.
- Perhaps Kant describes the moral point of view at a very general level that is neutral between different normative views.
- Kant contrasts a practical law with a mere maxim. My maxim in doing a particular action is (approximately) my reason for acting as I do. The maxim on which I do this action gives the description under which I choose to do it. If, for instance, I brush my teeth, my maxim is (normally) keeping my teeth clean. We might capture the maxim by saying that I brush my teeth to keep them clean, or that what I am doing in brushing my teeth is keeping my teeth clean (rather than wearing out the brush or exercising my arm).²² A mere maxim, unrelated to any practical law, appeals to a motive that may be present in different rational beings to different degrees. A practical law, by contrast, rests on some ground that applies to rational beings as such.²³ (Kant’s different remarks on maxims and laws seem to reflect some confusion. Sometimes he suggests that a maxim is a subjective principle and a law is an objective principle that we may or may not incorporate in our subjective principle; the law provides a justifying reason that becomes a motivating reason when it is incorporated in our maxim. See G 421n. In this sense both hypothetical and categorical imperatives should give practical laws. But Kant also (in KpV) seems to say that all laws are a priori, and the hypothetical imperative is a mere maxim. Perhaps he confuses different ways something can be subjective). Kant sets out to prove three claims: 
    - A practical law is a principle with a certain form. Kant fulflis his frist task by arguing that no material practical principles are laws (KpV 22), and that a law contains the determining grounds of the will (27). The only such law is the one that requires us to act on a maxim that could be a principle establishing universal law (30). 
    - There are principles with this form, and hence there are practical laws. In drawing a corollary from this ‘fundamental law of practical reason’, Kant fulflis his second and third tasks at once. He asserts that ‘pure reason is practical of itself alone, and it gives (to man) a universal law, which we call the moral law’ (31). 
    - Moral principles rest on practical laws. He does not argue separately that moral principles are practical laws; he explicates his conception of practical laws by reference to assumptions about morality. Suppose that you consider the maxim of denying that a deposit has been made when no one can prove the contrary, and you ask whether this maxim could be a universal law (27). Kant assumes that this question concerns the moral acceptability of the maxim. Similarly, in arguing that a free will must be determined by a pure and unconditional practical law, he appeals to our recognition of our ability to do what we regard as morally obligatory, apart from the comparative strength of our various desires (30). Our awareness of moral obligation is awareness of a practical law.²⁴ 
- Kant claims that principles are practical laws if they rely on some condition that is ‘recognized as objective, i.e., as valid for the will of every rational being’ (KpV 19). He does not mean that all rational agents recognize them as valid. He treats them as justifying reasons, not as exciting reasons, for all rational agents. In his view, not all justifying reasons rest on the desires of the agents for whom they are justifying reasons. Some reasons rest on facts about agents that they may not recognize or care about. Practical laws are valid for the will of every rational being, because of facts about rational beings, not primarily because of what rational beings recognize or desire. 
- Practical principles are laws if they ‘contain the determining grounds of the will because of their form and not because of their matter’. The matter of a practical principle is ‘the object of the will’. Every practical principle has an object whose role determines the character of the principle. If the object is also the determining ground of the will, the principle is not a practical law. In a practical law, the form of the principle, abstracted from the object, gives the determining ground. A purely formal justifying reason distinguishes practical laws from those justifying reasons that depend on some further feature of a specific kind of rational agent.²⁵ 
- Kant distinguishes (in order to act, the agent needs both the objective ground and the subjective ground — both a representation of the state of affairs aimed at and a desire to realize it.²⁸):
    - the objective ground of self-determination — the end (Zweck), which is also the ground of determination (Bewegungsgrund) of the action - If someone wants to eat an apple, the eating of the apple is the objective ground; it is the intentional object, or state of affairs represented as desirable. Kant uses ‘objective’ in the Scholastic sense, referring to the object of thought.²⁷ The objective ground need not be an existing object, and need not be valid for all rational agents. It is objective simply because it is a represented state of affairs, rather than an attitude the agent takes to it. 
    - the subjective ground of desire (Begehren) — the incentive (or ‘spring’, Triebfeder) that causes me to do the action. The ‘incentive’ is the agent’s desire for the object. We often use ‘motive’ as Kant uses ‘incentive’ here,
- An agent’s purpose (desire to realize the state of affairs) or object (representation of the state of affairs) cannot belong to a practical law, because Kant has a narrow conception of purposes and objects. In his view, they are all the products of empirical desires and impulses, and therefore are empirical objects of the will. These empirical objects may vary from one agent to another (whether or not they actually vary). If they were the basis of moral principles, the reasons given by moral principles would also vary according to the different desires of different agents. These empirical objects could not support practical laws. But this conclusion might still allow an object of desire to be the basis of practical laws. ‘Object of desire’ might refer either to what a given agent desires or to what is desirable for, or ought to be desired by, this sort of agent. If something is desirable for all rational agents as such, whether or not they desire it, it could be the basis, for all Kant has said so far, of practical laws. Kant has not shown that there can be no such object of desire; and therefore he has not shown that no object of desire could be a basis for practical laws. 
- Kant assumes that practical laws must be known a priori, but he gives no distinct argument for this claim. He refers to ‘the necessity which is conceived in every law, an objective necessity arising from a priori grounds’ (KpV 26), and remarks that ‘practical laws ... must have an objective and not just subjective necessity, and ... must be known a priori by reason instead of by experience’ (KpV 26). They must be known a priori because they apply to rational agents as rational.²⁹ Practical laws are derived from the ‘universal concept of a rational being generally’ (G 412); we can understand them without reference to mere empirical facts about human beings. 







# Difficulties

- Butler, Reid, and Sidgwick say that the rational pursuit of happiness gives us the reason that impartial justice is even more rational that pursuit of happiness. In trying to maintain the rationality of the affection for justice without allowing the rationality of the desire for happiness, Kant weakens his case for the supremacy of justice.
- The non-eudaemonist intellectualist interpretationofScotusanticipatesaKantianargumentforconnectingfreedomwithpractical reason. This argument raises difficulties for Kant that are parallel to some of the difficulties that we have found in trying to make room for Scotus’ voluntarism. Both Scotus and Kant may be better off with a more intellectualist conception of freedom than the one that they tend to accept. 
- Kant departs further than Butler departs from Aristotelian eudaemonism, since he rejects the naturalist account of virtue and the harmony of self-love and conscience. 
- Voluntarism is one element in the Kantian conception of the will. But Kant does not give up the connexion between the will and practical reason. The voluntarist aspects of his position conflict with the intellectualist aspects. He returns to Scotus’ belief that the affection for justice is somehow constitutive of, not simply one possible manifestation of, the freedom of the will; and so some of the objections to Scotus seem to fit Kant as well.
- The question draws attention to an important aspect of eudaemonism. We might wrongly take a eudaemonist to rely on an empirical, though universal, feature of human beings, that they desire happiness. This is how Kant interprets the desire for happiness.
