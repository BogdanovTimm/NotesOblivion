- Balguy, Price, and Reid, who develop and defend Clarke’s rationalism in more detail, and examine some of the objections about moral knowledge, motivation, and justification that seem to arise for Clarke.
- Price notices this parallel between egoism and utilitarianism.²⁹ His argument against egoism is quite similar to Hutcheson’s, but he believes that the same sort of argument undermines Hutcheson’s utilitarianism. Though his argument does not do justice to indirect utilitarianism, it raises serious questions about Hutcheson’s whole system. 
- It would be consistent to agree with Doddridge and Grove about the divine nature against voluntarists and sentimentalists, and still to accept utilitarianism; for one might argue that a perfectly reasonable agent will accept utilitarianism. Cumberland holds that God rationally chooses to promote the common good because this is the reasonable end; and one might defend a parallel claim about utility. Hutcheson’s rationalist opponents, however, deny that practical reason supports utilitarianism; Balguy, Butler, Doddridge, and Price all maintain that practical reason imposes some limits on the pursuit of maximum utility.
- Price follows Butler in claiming both that self-love is a rational principle and that the object of one’s self-love is simply happiness, conceived as pleasure.²⁷
- pluralist intuitionist view defended by Price and Reid.⁴⁴ This view recognizes a number of ultimate principles none of which is supreme, and none of which provides any systematic reasoned basis for deciding conflicts among principles. 
- Price and Sidgwick agree with this criticism of Butler, and infer that he ought not to have maintained the harmony of self-love and conscience.⁶⁷ But the doctrine of harmony is neither an optional extra in Butler’s position nor a mere persuasive device for commending morality to those who do not accept it for better reasons. We have seen that it is also part of Butler’s defence of the natural character of conscience and morality.⁶⁸ If Butler abandoned the doctrine of harmony, he would seriously weaken his naturalism as well. Price and Sidgwick seethis,andsotheyabandonButler’snaturalismwhentheyabandonhisdoctrineofharmony. 
- Both Hume and Price notice that Hutcheson’s position on authority is unsatisfactory. In Hume’s view, the concession to Butler is a mistake. In Price’s view, Hutcheson is right to agree with Butler, but wrong to suppose that the moral sense meets Butler’s conditions for an authoritative principle.²⁰ Both critics argue, from their opposite points of view, that Hutcheson can restore consistency to his position only by moving either to a more rationalist or to a more anti-rationalist view.
- Price and Reid, following Butler, reject sentimentalism, and so reject the sentimentalist argument for utilitarianism. They believe that their meta-ethical rationalism and their non-utilitarian account of justice confirm each other, and that both views rest on ordinary moral convictions. 
- He presents his moral philosophy as part of a systematic philosophical outlook; he argues that rationalist ethics gains support from its relation to his general epistemological position.⁷ 
- In contrast to Hobbes, Butler, Hutcheson, and Hume,⁸ Price begins not with an account of human nature, but with questions in moral epistemology. His epistemological argument is fundamental; ‘if I have failed here, I have failed in my chief design’ (3). His most original contribution to moral theory is perhaps his special emphasis on epistemology rather than on psychology. His epistemological emphasis does not abandon moral psychology, but imposes a condition of adequacy on any account of human nature. If our account of human nature leaves us without the capacity to acquire the sort of knowledge that our epistemology tells us we acquire, or if it leaves us with no account of how this knowledge could guide our action, the account has to be revised. 
- In Hutcheson psychology determines epistemology; for he believes that the sort of moral knowledge that rationalists attribute to us could not influence our actions in the way that moral knowledge plainly does, and so he infers that his moral psychology shows the error in rationalist epistemology.⁹ Price seems to reverse Hutcheson’s direction of argument.
He claims that since the kind of knowledge that clearly guides our action does not fit into Hutcheson’s moral psychology, that moral psychology must be wrong. He does not, therefore, discuss the questions in moral psychology very extensively in their own right.
- Price approaches questions about self-love and other affections through a general view of affections (69). Affections are distinguished by their objects, and their objects essentially includedistinctiveends; curiosity, forinstance, istheloveofwhat isnewanduncommon, and ambition is the love of fame. Hume includes affections of this sort under the passions, which he takes to be distinguished by their distinctive sensations, connected only empirically with their objects. Price, by contrast, takes a distinctive object and a distinctive end to be internally connected to a given affection. Hence, he claims, psychological egoism—understood as the doctrine that we desire everything simply as a means to our own good—implies that we really have only one affection, self-love. 
- In affirming this internal connexion between affection, object, and end, Price maintains that pride is necessarily pride in some apparent good, and humiliation necessarily responds to an apparent evil. Hume, on the contrary, takes these connexions of emotions to objects to be contingent. Hence he believes that passions cannot be reasonable or unreasonable, because they do not admit of truth or falsehood. Price takes the more plausible view that passions may be reasonable or unreasonable, and some actually are reasonable. 
- He uses his account of affections and their objects to support Butler’s attack on psycho-logical hedonism (74–6). He argues that any pleasure in obtaining x presupposes a prior affection for x. Since we have an affection for x only if we desire x for its own sake, the pleasure in obtaining x presupposes a desire for x for its own sake; hence we cannot consistently claim that we take pleasure in obtaining the object of our desires and that the only thing we desire for its own sake is pleasure.
Price fails, as Butler fails, to show that every pleasure presupposes an independent desire for its object.¹⁰ But the exaggeration does not defeat Price’s main point. If any pleasures are value-dependent, they raise a difficulty for psychological hedonism. 
- The internal connexions between pleasure and desire, and between desire, object, and end, suggest to Price that a pleasure is internally connected to its object.¹¹ If our pleas-ure in friendship is essentially directed towards friendship, pleasure cannot be all we want. If we could gain pleasure equivalent to or greater than the pleasure of friend-ship, but without friendship, we would still want friendship in addition to this added pleasure. 
- Price follows Butler not only in his rejection of psychological hedonism, but also in a concession to prudential hedonism, identifying the object of rational self-love with happiness, and identifying this happiness with pleasure. He seems to take the equivalence of happiness and pleasure for granted. When he argues against the view that virtue secures happiness, he contents himself with listing the painful incidents that sometimes result from virtue. 
- Price defends the rational character of self-love by arguing that our desire for happiness cannot be the product of instinct.²¹To suggest that a desire is instinctive, as Price understands the term, is to suggest that we could have been the same sorts of beings as we are but have lacked this particular desire. If, for instance, we tend to prefer the taste of sweet things over sour things, but could have been the sorts of beings that we are without this preference, our preference is instinctive.
On this basis, Price distinguishes:
    - affections - Affections are ‘desires founded in the reasonable nature itself, and essential to it; such as self-love, benevolence, and the love of truth’ (74). They belong to reasonable natures because they are reasonable desires to have, not because they happen to be found in reasonable creatures.²² A creature would not be reasonable if it did not see the reasons that support such desires and were not moved by these reasons. Affections in this general sense may be strengthened by ‘instinctive determinations’; we not only recognize, and act on, the reasonableness of concern for our own interest, but we also have a non-essential feeling that favours it, and this feeling (we might say) gives us a Humean exciting reason that supports the non-Humean exciting reason that belongs to us as reasonable creatures. Once he has distinguished affections from passions, Price denies that the desire for happiness is simply a passion.²³ Since it is not instinctive, it is a rational principle, and it is contrary to reason to refrain from pursuing happiness, either for oneself or for others 
    - passions
- The question draws attention to an important aspect of eudaemonism. We might wrongly take a eudaemonist to rely on an empirical, though universal, feature of human beings, that they desire happiness. This is how Kant interprets the desire for happiness.²⁴ Price rejects this interpretation, because he believes the desire is necessary for a rational agent. Price’s conception of happiness, however, does not fit his claim that the desire for happiness is necessary for a rational agent. The pursuit of happiness does not seem rationally necessary, if happiness and pleasure (as a hedonist understands it) are identified. Unless pleasure is defined so as to imply a necessary connexion between pleasure and the fulfilment of desire, it does not seem obvious that every rational agent must pursue pleasure. Even if we take pleasure to be a by-product of fulfilled desire, it does not seem obvious that rational agents must actually pursue pleasure; why could they not care simply about the fulfilment of their desire and be indifferent about the pleasure resulting from it? Price makes it difficult to see why the desire for happiness expresses a rational principle that is necessary for a rational agent. 
- Price rejects the sentimentalist conception of moral judgment and the anti-rationalist conception of will and action on which it rests. He seems to be a rationalist about motivation in general, not just about morality. He believes that some objects have a ‘natural aptitude’ to please or displease us.²⁸ Relying on his distinction between affections and passions, he argues that we have certain desires and reactions not because we are first reasonable beings and then acquire the appropriate affections, but simply because we recognize reasons.
- In his view, motives are not ‘physical efficients and agents’ (211; cf. 183n);³³ they cannot effect our determination, and our judgments are not physically connected with our action (183n).
We might take these remarks in either of two ways: 
    - Motives cannot be parts of sufficient causal conditions for our actions, because our actions have no sufficient causal conditions. This interpretation commits Price to indeterminism. 
    - Even if our motives cause our actions, we are still the causes of our actions. This simply commits him to some account of the cause of our actions that makes ourselves the cause. If such an account can be offered within determinist assumptions, it should satisfy the demands implied in the second claim. Price seems to recognize that responsibility may not require indeterminism.³⁴ If a doctrine of necessity can be explained so as to retain his claims about agency, it allows moral responsibility. But he does not say what sort of doctrine of necessity would satisfy him. Hume, for instance, presents a doctrine of necessity that he takes to be compatible with the freedom that is relevant to moral responsibility. But Price does not say whether Hume’s version of the doctrine of necessity safeguards responsibility. He might reasonably claim that Hume’s view deprives the self and the rational will of an appropriate role in free action. 
- Since Price rejects sentimentalism about desire and action, he has no reason to favour sentimentalism about moral properties. In his view, it is not only unnecessary for capturing the connexion between morality and action, but also morally inadequate. He argues for a combination of rationalism and realism. He assumes, as Cudworth does, that rationalism and realism are inseparable. We might question this assumption. For might we not accept rationalism and still believe that our moral knowledge is knowledge of the tendencies of our own reason, rather than knowledge of objective moral properties?³⁵ Alternatively, might we not reject rationalism and believe that sense, either the ordinary senses or an additional sense, gives us moral knowledge of external reality?³⁶ Price concentrates on realist rationalism and an anti-realist doctrine of a moral sense because he rejects a moral sense and embraces rationalism. He allows that if Hutcheson’s doctrine of the moral sense asserted only that moral judgments are immediate, it would be innocuous. But it is not innocuous when Hutcheson adds that moral properties have the status of secondary qualities. Price agrees with Hutcheson in believing that secondary qualities are not genuine differences in objects themselves, but simply reflect features of ourselves and our reactions (14).³⁷ He does not endorse Reid’s more robustly realist account of the senses and their objects, and so he does not regard belief in a moral sense as a reliable support for objectivism about moral properties (280–3).³⁸ 
- According to Price, moral properties would be objects of a moral sense only if they did not belong to actions and people themselves, but belonged only to our reactions.³⁹ Hutcheson derives this conclusion illegitimately from the immediacy of moral judgments.⁴⁰ In Price’s view, we must support the intellectual character of moral judgments and their correspondence to external reality, by rejecting the moral sense.
He rejects a moral sense theory by rejecting empiricism in general. He argues, for reasons similar to Cudworth’s, that many of the ideas that Locke takes to be derived from the senses are in fact derived from the understanding. He claims, for instance, that some ideas about causation are derived from understanding, since the senses give us experience only of succession. While Price agrees with Hume about what we learn from experience, he does not agree with Hume’s conclusion about the idea of necessary connexion (25–8). The understanding is the source of its own simple ideas, which are preconditions, not products, of reasoning (40). A moral sense theory is wrong because moral properties are not the sorts of properties that we grasp through a sense.
To prove his point, Price appeals to our intuitive belief that moral properties belong to actions in themselves, not simply to our reactions to them; when we call an action wrong, we attribute a property to the action itself, not to its effect on us as spectators.⁴¹ He admits that this intuitive belief is open to dispute, since it may be dismissed as the product of false ‘objectification’, the tendency of our mind to ‘spread itself’ (as Hume says) on objects (46 #1).
In reply he points out the absurdities (as he considers them) that result from the subjectivist position. He uses a version of Cudworth’s argument about mutability, claiming that his opponents’ view makes moral properties mutable in relation to certain other properties that in fact make no difference to moral properties.⁴² Defenders of a moral sense theory reject this criticism. In reply to Burnet and Balguy, Hutcheson argues that the senses are corrigible, but sensory qualities do not exist independ-ently of our perceptions of them. This defence of the subjectivist position does not answer Price. For if the views of the normal perceiver constitute correctness, moral properties are still mutable, not in relation to any particular perceiver, but in relation to changes in normal perceivers. People in general may become, say, more or less prone to approve compassion, benevolence, or honesty. But these qualities themselves do not become better or worse with these changes in perceivers. Hence, according to Price, sentimentalism mistakes the character of moral properties. 










#                  Difficulties 

- Whewell’s attitude to Price is over-simplified. Both of them tend to represent the rationalism of Clarke and Balguy as the only reasonable alternative to Hume. Neither of them clearly recognizes that Butler offers a significant option distinct both from Clarke’s rationalism and from sentimentalism. Price takes himself to maintain the position of Butler against the errors of Shaftesbury and Hutcheson. He does not discuss the significant differences between himself and Butler.⁵ Still, Price’s statement of a rationalist position is fuller and better defended than Clarke’s and Balguy’s. Price and Reid help us to understand what can be done for rationalism without traditional naturalism.⁶
- If the greatest pleasure is pleasure taken in the greatest non-instrumental good, we do not refute Plato’s claim that virtue promotes the greatest pleasure if we show that the virtuous person does not gain the greatest pleasure, as the non-virtuous person would estimate it. Price’s criticism of eudaemonism seems not to take account of the complications resulting from his view of pleasure and its objects. On this point he disagrees with Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics, who all claim that virtue is profitable precisely because they think it is to be chosen for its own sake. They take the good for an agent to include both the useful (utile, commodum) and the morally good (honestum). This connexion between the honestum and the good is especially clear in Suarez’s discussion. Price does not recognize this feature of some eudaemonist views. He seems to make Scotus’ mistake of supposing that in aiming at our good, we must aim at advantage, understood as a good that belongs exclusively to the agent.¹⁸ 
- According to Sidgwick, Butler sees the distinction between prudence and morality that is obscured by Greek moralists.¹⁹ But he agrees with eudaemonists in arguing for the harmony of conscience and self-love. Since Butler accepts a hedonist conception of happiness, he apparently ought to accept the fairly simple observations that Price uses to show that there is no reason to expect a general coincidence between virtue and pleasure; hence, apparently, Butler ought to admit that the same observations undermine any claim about the coincidence between virtue and happiness.
Perhaps, however, we ought not to draw this conclusion from Price and Butler. Instead of concluding that Butler should agree with Price in rejecting the harmony of conscience and self-love, perhaps we ought to conclude that both Butler and Price should reject a hedonist conception of happiness. If they pursued the implications of their views about pleasure and goodness, they would have good reason to agree with Butler, against Price, on the harmony of conscience and self-love.
- Price applies this general claim to the particular case of happiness. To show that our pursuit of happiness is not simply the product of instinct (in his sense), he argues that a being ‘purely reasonable . . . would not want [i.e., lack] all principles of action, and all inclinations’ (70–1). In fact ‘the nature of happiness also would engage him to choose and desire it for himself ’ (71). It is as evident that happiness is better than misery as it is that a whole is greater than one of its parts.²⁹ No prior desire for happiness explains why a rational agent pursues happiness; the mere knowledge of what happiness is moves us by itself to pursue it.³⁰ Price’s comparison of ‘happiness is better than misery’ to ‘the whole is greater than one of its parts’ does not really clarify his position. The statement about whole and parts is analytic; we will assent to it as soon as we know the meaning of ‘whole’ and ‘part’. The statement about happiness, however, does not seem to be analytic (especially if we accept Price’s conception of happiness); and even if it were, Price would not have explained why the belief that something is better for us should be supposed to move us to action by itself.
One might reply that the belief that something is good for us will move us if we are rational agents; this is part of what it is to be a rational agent. This reply might not secure Price’s main point, however. If we are rational agents, our desires are responsive to considerations of relative importance and coherence; this order in an agent’s desires constitutes, in Aquinas’ view, a desire for happiness. It is not clear, then, that Price avoids the ascription of desire to a rational agent who is moved by considerations of what is best. Though the desire for one’s own good is not an instinct, it does not follow that the belief that something is good for us moves us by itself. Still, part of Price’s position may be defensible; for he would be justified in claiming that, even if we acknowledge the necessity of desire for action, desire does not explain why we act on the belief that something is worth pursuing. Our having a desire to pursue what is worth pursuing simply follows from the fact that we act on this sort of belief.³¹
- It is unfortunate that Price comes no closer than Cudworth comes to identifying the crucial errors in the Hobbesian doctrine of necessity. Cudworth’s emphasis on the importance of rational motives raises doubts about Hobbes’s and Hume’s version of compatibilism, since they allow any sort of motive to be equally sufficient for the relevant sort of freedom. Price ought to agree with Cudworth on this point, given the rest of his rationalist view; but he does not make his position clear.
