- Moral terms can't be reduced to non-moral ones
- Rationalism (virtue = to be guided by praxtical reason) is true
- Non-instrumental and overriding value of morality are true
- Intuitionism is true: we can grasp principles of benevolence independently of grasping principles of justice. And they may conflict. Then, to resolve the conflict, we need third grasping of principles
- Argues that Hutcheson’s belief in a moral sense requires him to reject realism and the metaphysical independence of morality. 
- oppose theological voluntarism. 
- An appeal to Scripture and reason seemed to many Dissenters — notably Price — to undermine the dogmas set out in the historic creeds, and in particular the doctrine of the Trinity
- InPrice, the belief in intrinsic morality is separated from naturalism,
- Balguy, Price, and Reid, who develop and defend Clarke’s rationalism in more detail, and examine some of the objections about moral knowledge, motivation, and justification that seem to arise for Clarke.
- Price notices this parallel between egoism and utilitarianism.²⁹ His argument against egoism is quite similar to Hutcheson’s, but he believes that the same sort of argument undermines Hutcheson’s utilitarianism. Though his argument does not do justice to indirect utilitarianism, it raises serious questions about Hutcheson’s whole system. 
- It would be consistent to agree with Doddridge and Grove about the divine nature against voluntarists and sentimentalists, and still to accept utilitarianism; for one might argue that a perfectly reasonable agent will accept utilitarianism. Cumberland holds that God rationally chooses to promote the common good because this is the reasonable end; and one might defend a parallel claim about utility. Hutcheson’s rationalist opponents, however, deny that practical reason supports utilitarianism; Balguy, Butler, Doddridge, and Price all maintain that practical reason imposes some limits on the pursuit of maximum utility.
- Price follows Butler in claiming both that self-love is a rational principle and that the object of one’s self-love is simply happiness, conceived as pleasure.²⁷
- pluralist intuitionist view defended by Price and Reid.⁴⁴ This view recognizes a number of ultimate principles none of which is supreme, and none of which provides any systematic reasoned basis for deciding conflicts among principles. 
- Price and Sidgwick agree with this criticism of Butler, and infer that he ought not to have maintained the harmony of self-love and conscience.⁶⁷ But the doctrine of harmony is neither an optional extra in Butler’s position nor a mere persuasive device for commending morality to those who do not accept it for better reasons. We have seen that it is also part of Butler’s defence of the natural character of conscience and morality.⁶⁸ If Butler abandoned the doctrine of harmony, he would seriously weaken his naturalism as well. Price and Sidgwick seethis,andsotheyabandonButler’snaturalismwhentheyabandonhisdoctrineofharmony. 
- Both Hume and Price notice that Hutcheson’s position on authority is unsatisfactory. In Hume’s view, the concession to Butler is a mistake. In Price’s view, Hutcheson is right to agree with Butler, but wrong to suppose that the moral sense meets Butler’s conditions for an authoritative principle.²⁰ Both critics argue, from their opposite points of view, that Hutcheson can restore consistency to his position only by moving either to a more rationalist or to a more anti-rationalist view.
