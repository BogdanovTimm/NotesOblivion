- Moral terms can't be reduced to non-moral ones
- Rationalism (virtue = to be guided by praxtical reason) is true
- Non-instrumental and overriding value of morality are true
- Intuitionism is true: we can grasp principles of benevolence independently of grasping principles of justice. And they may conflict. Then, to resolve the conflict, we need third grasping of principles
- Argues that Hutcheson’s belief in a moral sense requires him to reject realism and the metaphysical independence of morality. 
- oppose theological voluntarism. 
- An appeal to Scripture and reason seemed to many Dissenters — notably Price — to undermine the dogmas set out in the historic creeds, and in particular the doctrine of the Trinity
- InPrice, the belief in intrinsic morality is separated from naturalism,
- Balguy, Price, and Reid, who develop and defend Clarke’s rationalism in more detail, and examine some of the objections about moral knowledge, motivation, and justification that seem to arise for Clarke.
- Price notices this parallel between egoism and utilitarianism.²⁹ His argument against egoism is quite similar to Hutcheson’s, but he believes that the same sort of argument undermines Hutcheson’s utilitarianism. Though his argument does not do justice to indirect utilitarianism, it raises serious questions about Hutcheson’s whole system. 
- It would be consistent to agree with Doddridge and Grove about the divine nature against voluntarists and sentimentalists, and still to accept utilitarianism; for one might argue that a perfectly reasonable agent will accept utilitarianism. Cumberland holds that God rationally chooses to promote the common good because this is the reasonable end; and one might defend a parallel claim about utility. Hutcheson’s rationalist opponents, however, deny that practical reason supports utilitarianism; Balguy, Butler, Doddridge, and Price all maintain that practical reason imposes some limits on the pursuit of maximum utility.
- Price follows Butler in claiming both that self-love is a rational principle and that the object of one’s self-love is simply happiness, conceived as pleasure.²⁷
- pluralist intuitionist view defended by Price and Reid.⁴⁴ This view recognizes a number of ultimate principles none of which is supreme, and none of which provides any systematic reasoned basis for deciding conflicts among principles. 
- Price and Sidgwick agree with this criticism of Butler, and infer that he ought not to have maintained the harmony of self-love and conscience.⁶⁷ But the doctrine of harmony is neither an optional extra in Butler’s position nor a mere persuasive device for commending morality to those who do not accept it for better reasons. We have seen that it is also part of Butler’s defence of the natural character of conscience and morality.⁶⁸ If Butler abandoned the doctrine of harmony, he would seriously weaken his naturalism as well. Price and Sidgwick seethis,andsotheyabandonButler’snaturalismwhentheyabandonhisdoctrineofharmony. 
- Both Hume and Price notice that Hutcheson’s position on authority is unsatisfactory. In Hume’s view, the concession to Butler is a mistake. In Price’s view, Hutcheson is right to agree with Butler, but wrong to suppose that the moral sense meets Butler’s conditions for an authoritative principle.²⁰ Both critics argue, from their opposite points of view, that Hutcheson can restore consistency to his position only by moving either to a more rationalist or to a more anti-rationalist view.
- Price and Reid, following Butler, reject sentimentalism, and so reject the sentimentalist argument for utilitarianism. They believe that their meta-ethical rationalism and their non-utilitarian account of justice confirm each other, and that both views rest on ordinary moral convictions. 
- He presents his moral philosophy as part of a systematic philosophical outlook; he argues that rationalist ethics gains support from its relation to his general epistemological position.⁷ 
- In contrast to Hobbes, Butler, Hutcheson, and Hume,⁸ Price begins not with an account of human nature, but with questions in moral epistemology. His epistemological argument is fundamental; ‘if I have failed here, I have failed in my chief design’ (3). His most original contribution to moral theory is perhaps his special emphasis on epistemology rather than on psychology. His epistemological emphasis does not abandon moral psychology, but imposes a condition of adequacy on any account of human nature. If our account of human nature leaves us without the capacity to acquire the sort of knowledge that our epistemology tells us we acquire, or if it leaves us with no account of how this knowledge could guide our action, the account has to be revised. 
- In Hutcheson psychology determines epistemology; for he believes that the sort of moral knowledge that rationalists attribute to us could not influence our actions in the way that moral knowledge plainly does, and so he infers that his moral psychology shows the error in rationalist epistemology.⁹ Price seems to reverse Hutcheson’s direction of argument.
He claims that since the kind of knowledge that clearly guides our action does not fit into Hutcheson’s moral psychology, that moral psychology must be wrong. He does not, therefore, discuss the questions in moral psychology very extensively in their own right.

- Whewell’s attitude to Price is over-simplified. Both of them tend to represent the rationalism of Clarke and Balguy as the only reasonable alternative to Hume. Neither of them clearly recognizes that Butler offers a significant option distinct both from Clarke’s rationalism and from sentimentalism. Price takes himself to maintain the position of Butler against the errors of Shaftesbury and Hutcheson. He does not discuss the significant differences between himself and Butler.⁵ Still, Price’s statement of a rationalist position is fuller and better defended than Clarke’s and Balguy’s. Price and Reid help us to understand what can be done for rationalism without traditional naturalism.⁶
