- Moral terms can't be reduced to non-moral ones
- Rationalism (virtue = to be guided by praxtical reason) is true
- Non-instrumental and overriding value of morality are true
- Intuitionism is true: we can grasp principles of benevolence independently of grasping principles of justice. And they may conflict. Then, to resolve the conflict, we need third grasping of principles
- Argues that Hutcheson’s belief in a moral sense requires him to reject realism and the metaphysical independence of morality. 
- oppose theological voluntarism. 
- An appeal to Scripture and reason seemed to many Dissenters — notably Price — to undermine the dogmas set out in the historic creeds, and in particular the doctrine of the Trinity
- InPrice, the belief in intrinsic morality is separated from naturalism,
- Balguy, Price, and Reid, who develop and defend Clarke’s rationalism in more detail, and examine some of the objections about moral knowledge, motivation, and justification that seem to arise for Clarke.
- Price notices this parallel between egoism and utilitarianism.²⁹ His argument against egoism is quite similar to Hutcheson’s, but he believes that the same sort of argument undermines Hutcheson’s utilitarianism. Though his argument does not do justice to indirect utilitarianism, it raises serious questions about Hutcheson’s whole system. 
- It would be consistent to agree with Doddridge and Grove about the divine nature against voluntarists and sentimentalists, and still to accept utilitarianism; for one might argue that a perfectly reasonable agent will accept utilitarianism. Cumberland holds that God rationally chooses to promote the common good because this is the reasonable end; and one might defend a parallel claim about utility. Hutcheson’s rationalist opponents, however, deny that practical reason supports utilitarianism; Balguy, Butler, Doddridge, and Price all maintain that practical reason imposes some limits on the pursuit of maximum utility.
