- There is 3 types of freewill:
    - Independence from external actions - we have it
    - Independence from external causes - we don't have it (because God gives us the cause)
    - Independence from passions - we don't have it
- Division between will and passions are un-Biblical
- Intellectualists account of freewill is false
- We always follow our strongest passion
