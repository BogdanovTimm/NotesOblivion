- Christianuty conflicts with Greek ethics
- Natural Low can be find without the help of God
- The Decalogue makes Natural Low clearer
- Voluntarism about God's will is false: God can't will bad things
- Pagans don't have right virtues becaues they do not love God
- There is no infused moral virtues
- Good actions are nothing more than consequences of God's justification
- we need some reason to obey God’s commands rather than the commands of just anyone who chooses to issue idle commands. But the Hobbesian answer is available to the theological voluntarist too. According to this view, our reason may be that we love God⁵⁷ or we fear him; love or fear gives us an obligation insofar as they provide a motive, but they do not require any further claim about the rightness of obeying the command.
This is a voluntarist answer, and perhaps a Calvinist answer. 
- Though Butler does not mention natural law, he introduces it, as Clarke does, by appeal to St Paul’s claim that human beings are by nature a law to themselves (Rm. 2:15).³⁴ Aquinas cites this passage as a Scriptural warrant for including a doctrine of natural law in Christian moral theology. Luther and Calvin, among many others, agree with Aquinas.³⁵
