- Argues that Hutcheson’s belief in a moral sense requires him to reject realism and the metaphysical independence of morality.
- Balguy both accepts metaphysically independent morality and is somewhat sympathetic to utilitarianism.
- oppose theological voluntarism. 
- Shaftesbury sketches a defence that is developed more fully, and with more specifci reference to orthodox Christianity, by Clarke and Balguy.⁵¹ 
- If Shaftesbury took approval by the moral sense to constitute moral properties, he would undermine his realism and his arguments against voluntarism. He would be subject to the argument that he aims at the theological voluntarists. In his view, we recognize God’s will as morally perfect because we regard moral properties as distinct from what God approves. Similarly, we recognize that someone’s moral sense is right because we believe in moral properties that are distinct from what the moral sense approves. Balguy uses this argument effectively against Hutcheson’s belief in a constitutive relation between the moral sense and moral properties.⁵⁵
- Hutcheson takes a step that Shaftesbury does not take, by defniing moral goodness as essentially what is approved by the moral sense. He takes the moral sense to be disinterested, and therefore he supposes that he defends Shaftesbury. This interpretation of the moral sense and its relation to moral goodness is also Berkeley’s interpretation of Shaftesbury, and it is the basis for Berkeley’s criticism.⁵⁷ But Hutcheson overlooks the fact that he defends only the motivational part of Shaftesbury’s realist doctrine, and that he undermines the metaphysical part. Balguy points out this consequence of Hutcheson’s modification of Shaftesbury; he shows that Hutcheson’s position exposes him to Shaftesbury’s argument against theological voluntarism.⁵⁸ 
- While Balguy defends ftiness as a morally relevant and signifciant feature that makes actions right, Adams appeals directly to the immediate judgment that actions are right and wrong, without trying to explain this through fitness and unfitness.²⁹ 
- Balguy, Price, and Reid, who develop and defend Clarke’s rationalism in more detail, and examine some of the objections about moral knowledge, motivation, and justification that seem to arise for Clarke.
- The rationalist Balguy argues that if we are moved wholly by non-rational desires for ends, we do not act freely and responsibly; he assumes that merit requires freedom, and freedom requires the capacity for rational motivation.⁶²
- Balguy answers that Clarke’s appeal to motivation by reason is preferable to Hutcheson’s theory of desire and action, and that Clarke’s analysis of moral judgment as rational recognition of eternal fitnesses is both true and informative. 
- Balguy criticizes this sentimentalist view. He agrees with Hutcheson’s objections to libertarian accounts of freedom that identify free action with action on no sufficient motive. But he notices that Hutcheson takes these objections to imply the impossibility of action that is not the result of non-rational instinct.² Balguy believes that if Hutcheson were right on this point, we could not justify ordinary judgments about merit, which presume rational motivation, as opposed to non-rational motivation by instinct.³ Internal determination of actions does not ensure the sort of freedom that is relevant to moral merit and demerit; hence the sentimentalist account of motivation fails to identify this freedom. Since some sort of rational motivation is necessary for freedom, motivation by sentiment, as the sentimentalists understand it, is insufficient for freedom. 
- Can the idea of motivation by reason be made more intelligible than Hutcheson supposes? Balguy suggests that recognition of the intrinsic merits of a course of action may move us to action, without any further appeal to a non-rational instinct.⁴ If we are rational agents, we can be moved by the merits of a course of action; that claim is no less intelligible and explanatory than the anti-rationalist appeal to a prior non-rational instinct.⁵ 
- On behalf of Hutcheson one might say that simply citing a belief is not enough to explain an action, and that we explain an action better if we cite both a belief and a suitably connected non-rational desire. Balguy suggests that it is no less explanatory to cite a belief in the intrinsic merits of a course of action. To be a rational agent is to be capable of acting on the recognition of intrinsic merits. 
- If Balguy is right to object to Hutcheson’s anti-rationalism about motivation, he is also right to object to his analysis of free will. For one might reasonably argue that the capacity to act on the apparent merits of different courses of action, and not simply to be moved by one’s strongest non-rational desire, is essential to the freedom that is relevant to praise and blame. Hutcheson’s attempt to dissolve questions about freedom by taking all determination by desire to imply freedom is open to objection. 
- Common sense assumes that morality in some way expresses freedom because it involves motivation by reason; but this assumption rests—according to the sentimentalist—on a mistaken view about practical reason.⁶ Still, even if a sentimentalist might take this more sceptical attitude to freedom, Balguy still shows that Hutcheson’s actual attitude is unsatisfactory; the arguments that Hutcheson offers neither support common views on freedom nor prove that rationalist views are less explanatory than Hutcheson’s anti-rationalism. 
- Hutcheson replies that Burnet’s appeal to the reasonableness of one or another end is empty.¹⁰ An end is not reasonable in its own right, but only in relation to some further end for which we have an antecedent desire. Similarly, we cannot judge an end reasonable except relatively to a further desired end. Hence judgments about reasonableness must depend on a further desire; hence we need a moral sense. To show that an end cannot be reasonable in its own right, Hutcheson argues that it is always appropriate to ask ‘What makes it reasonable?’. To say that nothing makes it reasonable, or that it makes itself reasonable, is uninformative. To say what makes it reasonable, we always have to say that it appeals to us on the basis of some further end we care about. In the case of morality, the relevant further end is the public good, which appeals to our moral sense. The mere claim that something is reasonable in itself is an appeal to an alleged brute fact. BurnetandBalguyreplythatsomereasonsmustbetakenasultimate,sincewecannotshow their reasonableness by appeal to further reasons. Similarly (according to Clarke and Burnet) no further reason can be given for accepting a mathematical axiom, but we do not infer that mathematical judgment requires a further contribution from the affections. On the contrary, mathematical judgments consist in recognizing axioms as ultimate reasons and in reasoning in accordance with them. It is equally appropriate to recognize ultimately reasonable moral principles and to judge in accordance with them. If they are ultimately reasonable, no more ultimate reasons can be given to show that they are reasonable; but it doesnotfollowthatwemustappealtosomefurthernon-rationaldesire.BalguyagreesthatifI recognizeamoralprincipleasultimatelyreasonable,Iwillnormallywanttoactinaccordance with it; but he claims that the desire results from the recognition, and does not explain it.¹¹ If a defender of Hutcheson objects that Balguy is appealing to a mere brute fact, not further explained, Balguy might answer that Hutcheson also appeals to a brute fact—a non-rational desire and a tendency to act on that desire. Can we not ask why we should act on that desire? The question ‘Why should I?’ suggests that we are looking for some further reason that Hutcheson fails to provide.  In this dispute about brute facts the anti-rationalist complains that the rationalist cannot say why we act on what we see to be ultimately reasonable. The rationalist complains that the anti-rationalist cannot say why we should act on basic non-rational desires for ends. The anti-rationalist, therefore, complains about the rationalist’s failure to provide a motivating reason, whereas the rationalist complains about the anti-rationalist’s failure to provide a normative reason. At first sight, both complaints seem reasonable. Balguy’s discussion shows that Hutcheson’s assumptions about explanation and reasons do not define all the legitimate questions that can be raised.

- Clarke and Balguy agree with Parker’s conception of happiness (His argument against Greek Moralists assumes a broadly hedonistic conception of happiness, which leads him to misunderstand the Stoic and the Aristotelian and Platonic position), and hence with his assertion that Greek moral philosophy cannot assure the appropriate connexion between virtue and happiness.⁴²
