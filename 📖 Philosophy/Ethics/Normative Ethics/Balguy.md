- Argues that Hutcheson’s belief in a moral sense requires him to reject realism and the metaphysical independence of morality.
- Balguy both accepts metaphysically independent morality and is somewhat sympathetic to utilitarianism.
- oppose theological voluntarism. 
- Shaftesbury sketches a defence that is developed more fully, and with more specifci reference to orthodox Christianity, by Clarke and Balguy.⁵¹ 
- If Shaftesbury took approval by the moral sense to constitute moral properties, he would undermine his realism and his arguments against voluntarism. He would be subject to the argument that he aims at the theological voluntarists. In his view, we recognize God’s will as morally perfect because we regard moral properties as distinct from what God approves. Similarly, we recognize that someone’s moral sense is right because we believe in moral properties that are distinct from what the moral sense approves. Balguy uses this argument effectively against Hutcheson’s belief in a constitutive relation between the moral sense and moral properties.⁵⁵
- Hutcheson takes a step that Shaftesbury does not take, by defniing moral goodness as essentially what is approved by the moral sense. He takes the moral sense to be disinterested, and therefore he supposes that he defends Shaftesbury. This interpretation of the moral sense and its relation to moral goodness is also Berkeley’s interpretation of Shaftesbury, and it is the basis for Berkeley’s criticism.⁵⁷ But Hutcheson overlooks the fact that he defends only the motivational part of Shaftesbury’s realist doctrine, and that he undermines the metaphysical part. Balguy points out this consequence of Hutcheson’s modification of Shaftesbury; he shows that Hutcheson’s position exposes him to Shaftesbury’s argument against theological voluntarism.⁵⁸ 
- While Balguy defends ftiness as a morally relevant and signifciant feature that makes actions right, Adams appeals directly to the immediate judgment that actions are right and wrong, without trying to explain this through fitness and unfitness.²⁹ 
- Balguy, Price, and Reid, who develop and defend Clarke’s rationalism in more detail, and examine some of the objections about moral knowledge, motivation, and justification that seem to arise for Clarke.
- The rationalist Balguy argues that if we are moved wholly by non-rational desires for ends, we do not act freely and responsibly; he assumes that merit requires freedom, and freedom requires the capacity for rational motivation.⁶²
- Balguy answers that Clarke’s appeal to motivation by reason is preferable to Hutcheson’s theory of desire and action, and that Clarke’s analysis of moral judgment as rational recognition of eternal fitnesses is both true and informative. 
- Balguy criticizes this sentimentalist view. He agrees with Hutcheson’s objections to libertarian accounts of freedom that identify free action with action on no sufficient motive. But he notices that Hutcheson takes these objections to imply the impossibility of action that is not the result of non-rational instinct.² Balguy believes that if Hutcheson were right on this point, we could not justify ordinary judgments about merit, which presume rational motivation, as opposed to non-rational motivation by instinct.³ Internal determination of actions does not ensure the sort of freedom that is relevant to moral merit and demerit; hence the sentimentalist account of motivation fails to identify this freedom. Since some sort of rational motivation is necessary for freedom, motivation by sentiment, as the sentimentalists understand it, is insufficient for freedom. 
- Can the idea of motivation by reason be made more intelligible than Hutcheson supposes? Balguy suggests that recognition of the intrinsic merits of a course of action may move us to action, without any further appeal to a non-rational instinct.⁴ If we are rational agents, we can be moved by the merits of a course of action; that claim is no less intelligible and explanatory than the anti-rationalist appeal to a prior non-rational instinct.⁵

- Clarke and Balguy agree with Parker’s conception of happiness (His argument against Greek Moralists assumes a broadly hedonistic conception of happiness, which leads him to misunderstand the Stoic and the Aristotelian and Platonic position), and hence with his assertion that Greek moral philosophy cannot assure the appropriate connexion between virtue and happiness.⁴²
