- Following Hutcheson’s lead, Martineau regards Shaftesbury and Hutcheson as the representatives of ‘aesthetic ethics’.² This position includes the metaphysical claim that the object of moral judgment is not external reality, but some state of oneself. That is why the judgment of conscience does not involve the mind’s ‘submission to the truth of external things’. Aesthetic ethics also includes the epistemological claim that moral judgment belongs to emotion not to reason, so that the right is known because it is felt.
