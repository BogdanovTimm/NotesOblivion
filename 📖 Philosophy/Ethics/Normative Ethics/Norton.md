* Norton, DH 120, overlooks this vital distinction. Hence he attributes ‘moral realism’ to Hume because of ‘the view that there are moral distinctions grounded in real existences that are independent of the observer’s mind . . .’. He is right in attributing this view to Hume if ‘grounded in’ means simply that our moral sentiments are excited by these real existences (killing of an innocent victim, e.g.). But to recognize that moral distinctions are grounded in real existences only in this sense is not to be a moral realist. Norton does not face the further question, whether moral properties themselves are (as opposed to being in some sense ‘grounded in’) real existences; but that is the question one needs to answer to decide whether Hume is a moral realist.
