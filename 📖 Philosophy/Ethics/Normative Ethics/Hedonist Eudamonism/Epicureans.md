- Virtues not only necessary for happiness, but also are sufficient for happiness
- Wisdom is only Instrumental Good
- One's long-term Pleasure requires Virtues (ones who don't see that fact are just miscalculated long-term Pleasures and long-term Pains)
- You can tune up your desires
- Virtuous people are happy precisely because they adapt themselves to smaller or larger external resources; they neither refuse to enjoy abundance nor regret scarcity.
- undisturbed condition is the end
- Virtues has only non-instrumental valu
- Hedonism is true
- Atomist view of the world, with its denial of life after death, secures peace of mind and freedom from anxiety, and so ought to be adopted on hedonist grounds.
- Epicurus believes that reliance on the senses justif i es a non-sceptical conclusion about the external world and acceptance of the atomic theory; we do not need to abandon empiricism for rationalism in order to accept atomism.
- He denies the Cyrenaic view that a defence of hedonism conflicts with ordinary beliefs about the value of happiness and the rationality of the moral virtues.
- Epicurus agrees with Cynics' view that happiness depends on adapting one’s desires to circumstances rather than in the accumulation of the most intense sensations of pleasure. Epicurean sages, no less than Cynic sages, are independent of external conditions and can find their happiness in conditions that are in their power.
- Arguments for the version of determinism that excludes freedom (‘hard’ determinism) are unsound
- Empiricism is true
- Epicurus defends his hedonism in two ways: (1) He thinks his empiricist epistemology guarantees that pleasure is the end.⁸ (2) But he also claims to prove his point by dialectical argument from ordinary beliefs.⁹ First, Epicurus appeals to the evidence of the senses, to show that the pursuit of pleasure as the end is natural and inevitable. Then he recognizes that not everyone is a hedonist, and he offers to explain how the errors of non-hedonists might arise, ‘so that you may see clearly the origin of this mistake of people who reject pleasure and praise pain’ (Cic. F i 32). Rather than relying simply on the senses, Epicurus claims that a ‘preconception’ about pleasure underlies our beliefs about the good. The epistemological argument for hedonism expresses Epicurus’ view that our sensations of pleasure are the analogue to sensory perceptions, which he takes to be invariably true (DL × 146–7). While Epicurus agrees with Aristotle in pursuing ethical inquiry, and other sorts of inquiry, from ‘appearances’, he has a different view of what the relevant appearances are. Those that Aristotle appeals to include common beliefs and ref l ective judgments, not simply the immediate impressions of the senses. But Epicurus believes, for anti-sceptical epistemological reasons (DL × 146), that immediate impressions are the only appropriate source of evidence.
- Denies skepticism about external objects by arguing that we must differ relative and main properties of objects
- Just as we follow the senses as guides to reality, so also we should follow our sensory affections as guides to the good.¹² Animals and children show us the natural tendency of our affections, before they are overlaid by misguided conventional beliefs about good and evil.¹³ If we attend to our affections, we recognize pleasure as the primary good, since it is the basis of all our natural conceptions of goodness, and as the ultimate good, since we aim at it in all our actions.
- My argument: I think Epicurus is Meta-Ethical Intuitionist
- we do not reject our sensory appearance that every pleasure is good, but neither do we rashly infer that every pleasure is to be chosen. Nor do we choose on the basis of something other than pleasure. We choose those actions that reliably offer pleasure over time, just as we rely on the sensory appearances that reliably inform us about the appearance of the stick over time. Our selective attitude towards pleasures does not conf l ict with hedonism; on the contrary, it follows from our initial appearance that pleasure is the good.¹⁵ If we look for what is reliably pleasant over time, we see that we need the ‘measuring science’ from the Plato's Protagoras
- Contrary to Plato and Aristotle, no pleasure is bad in its own right by being taken in an inappropriate object.
- Common beliefes exclude Hedonism
- Common beliefes can't be our starting point in the ethical inquery
- It is up to us to live as we choose and that we can affect our lives by deliberate decision and action
-Free will = when origin of my action starts in me
- Compatibilism is false, because if some external past events are sufficient to my actions - they are necesseey for my actions and since I am not free. So, he is Incompatibilist
- Determinism is false, because if some external past events determine our beliefs - then we hold our beliefs not because they true, but because we are forced by external power. So, Determinism may be true, but there is no good reason to belief in it
- Indeterminism is teue
- He secures the falsity of determinism by arguing that our atoms swerve indeterministically, and that therefore our choice and action are undetermined. Since the swerve breaks the deterministic sequence, the origin of my action is in me and nowhere else
- Types of pleasures:
    - Kinetic
    - Static:
        - freedom from pain
        - tranquillity

# Weaknesses

- The introduction of uncaused changes seems to imply that my character and my previous choices have no regular and reliable casual connexions to my current deliberation and choice.
