        - Internal - in our control
        - External - out of our control

#                  Values

Selective value - what we need to choose









#                  Final Good

##                 Happiness

Happiness (eudamonia) - set of all goods:
- Adaptive Conception of Happiness - the only non-instrumental goods are the fullfilled desires
- Hedonistic Eudamonism:
    - set of goods consists of maximum sum of pleasures
    - set of goods consists of freedom from pain
- Aristotelian - life in accordance with human nature (includes actions and states of character)

###                Properties of Happiness

- Comprehensive - includes all non-instrumental Goods
- Composite - includes more than 1 non-instrumental Good




##                 Virtues, being moral and happiness

Eudamonism - we have reason to value virtue and virtuous action as non-instrumentally good if and only if we regard them as a part of happiness.
Non-eudamonist - happiness may support being moral, though this certainly is not main reason to be moral.
Anti-eudamonist - virtues MUST not be viewed as means to happiness.

Greek eudaemonism asserts that whatever I choose for its own sake I regard as either a means to, or a part of, the good for me; but this restriction does not imply that the only thing I can choose for its own sake is a state exclusively of myself. We can consistently accept eudaemonism and value our friend’s good for our own sake, if we regard our friend’s good as part of the life that is best for us. While all the goods that I choose for their own sake are self-referential, they need not all be self-confnied. Whether they are all self-confnied is a further question to be answered by an account of what happiness consists in. 




##                 Pleasure

Hedonism:
- current pleasures




##                 Virtues

- Rationalism - rational part is a primary part for virtues (though non-rational may also participate in virtues)
- Anti-rationalist - good desires is sufficient for virtues; reason plays instrumental role

- prudence teaches us not to consent to bad inclinations
- temperance causes us not to consent to bad inclination









#                  Starting point

- Empiricism - our senses:
    - our senses of pleasure
- Dialectic - common beliefs









#             Self-confined vs Self-referential

- Self-referential - Good must somehow be connected to my happiness
- Self-confined - Good must consist ONLY in connection to my happiness









#                  Moral Psychology

- Intellectualism - we always choose the apparently greater good
- Voluntarism - we may choose bad things though we know that they are bad






#                  Random

Kant (according to some readers) appeals to a priori truths about the abstract form of practical reason and rational agency, in abstraction from facts about actual human beings, whereas Aristotle recognizes the relevance of psychological and social facts of the sort that Kant rejects as ‘mere’ anthropology. Aristotle (on this view) is a naturalist and Kant rejects naturalism.









#                  Soul

- Rational Part - will
- Non-Rational Part:
    - rational desires aka boulesis. Respond to the weight of normative reasons that we recognize in the course of deliberation. If we have rational desires, we respond to apparently better reasons, and do not simply register the comparative strength of desires. 
    - appetites aka concupiscent
    - spirit aka irascible









#                  Rationalism vs Sentimentalism aka Anti-Rationalism

It is a question about moral psychology:
- Anti-Rationalism - Strongest Passion can   solely determine the Will.
- Rationalism      - Strongest Passion can't solely determine the Will. Existense of External Reasons support Rationalism. It may be divided further on:
    - Extreme  Rationalism - motivation do not presuppose desire for an ultimate end.
    - Moderate Rationalism - motivation pressupose the desire for ultimate end, but it may be some specific object of desire that depends on reason.









#                  Intellectualism vs Voluntarism

It is a question about moral psychology:
- Intellectualism - Reason can determine the Will (alone or together with something else) by presenting the greater good to it:
    - Extreme  Intellectualism - (Reason can solely determine the Will) actions do not need a desire. My belief that X is better than Y moves me to choose X over Y.
    - Moderate Intellectualism - (Reason together with Desire can determine the Will) all action requires desire, but reasoning about the good produces the appropriate sort of desire. Some Desires moving us to action depend essentially on Practical Reason, and hence on beliefs about the good. We would not be rational agents if we lacked these Desires, constituting a Will. Aquinas.
- Voluntarism - Reason can't (at all) determine the Will by presenting the greater good to it and assert distinction between Passions and Will
- Sentimentalism - Reason can't (at all) determine the Will by presenting the greater good to it and reject distinction between Passions and Will






#                  Voluntarism vs Naturalism about Natural Law

According to one voluntarist view, nothing would be morally right or wrong if God has commanded nothing to us; our natural knowledge of the natural law is simply knowledge of the divine commands. On this view, natural law is natural in the epistemic sense, but not in the metaphysical sense. God was free to make us with the nature we have, but to command something different, and to give us natural knowledge of it; if God had done that, the principles of natural law would have been different, and the morally right and wrong would thereby have been different, even though our nature would have been the same.
According to the naturalist, nothing needs to be added to created nature for moral properties to exist; according to the voluntarist, divine legislation has to be added.








#                  Reasons

- Internal - depend on agent's desires
- External - do not depend on agent's desires









#                  Self-love vs Justice aka Conscience 

Self-love as:
- Hedonistic - desire for pleasure. Can't be used to argue for continuity of Self-love and Conscience  
- Abstract aka structural - abstract construct, that consists of the particular desires. May be used to argue for continuity of Self-love and Conscience









#                  Duality vs Dualism

- Duality - There are 2 things (we don't know about their relations. Maybe 1 thing is better then the other)
- Dualism - There a 2 things that are equally right









#                  Praise and blame

- Praise and Blame requires intellect









#                  Obligations and Duties

- Obligations and duties are the same, obligations don't requires imposition
- Obligations and duties are the same, obligations are imposed or incurred by voluntary action. Non-obligatory actions might create obligations or dutes - while people have no obligation to become parents, they incur obligations once they enter into these conditions
- Obligation requires not mere imposition, but imposition by a superior. If it is true, then God has duties, not obligations, toward us.
- Obligations and duties are the same, they both require imposition by a superior, but there are some right and wrong actions that are independent of obligation and duty.









#                   Laws

Types of Laws:
- Eternal Law - exists independently of God
- Divine  Law - created by God's will
- Natural Law - laws based on the nature of some creature

##                 Natural Law

Types of Natural Law by facts vs prescriptions:
- Naturalism  - Natural Law contains only moral facts (without prescriptions to do good)
- Voluntarism - Natural Law contains only prescriptions
- Both

Types of Natural Law by metaphysical vs epistemical:
- Metaphysical - Nnatyral Law is a Law that exists independent of God's will
- Epistemical - Natural Law is a Law that we can graspusing nothing more than our reason




##                 Positive vs Negative Law

- Non-positive law - the law that exists on its own
- Positive law - exists because of hte will of the legislator









#                  Obligation

How we can understand this:
- Impositive - obligation is when someone (including me) binding me do this
- Compulsory - obligation is when I rationally must do this
- Deontic - every ought (both moral or prudent) judgementsd are obligations
- Motivational - obligation is when it inclines to action









#                  Duty

- Imperative conception of duty - every duty implies obligation, every obligation implies the command.
- Non-imperative conception of obligation - every duty implies obligation, and some duties are independent of commands









#                  Jural vs Non-Jural Morals

- Jural - morality requires some legislation. It may have pre-legislation indicative facts, but they are not moral
- Non-Jural - morality operates with something that is good in itself









#                  Types of reductions

Types of reductions:
- Explanatory - 
- Vindicating
- Undermining









#                  Types of liberty

- self-determination - the ‘liberty of spontaneity’
- the capacity for opposites - the ‘liberty of indifference’









#                  Whewell's division of ethical positions

- Epistemology - Sentimentalists and rationalists disagree primarily on epistemological issues
- Metaphysics - Realists and anti-realists, and voluntarists and naturalists, disagree primarily on metaphysical issues
- Normative Ethics - Consequentialists and non-consequentialists disagree primarily on normative issues. 

Sentimentalists && anti-Voluntarists. 









#                  Moral Realism

I think you are a moral realist if you think that right can't be reduced to pleasure or advantage.






# Versions of Hedonism

- Psychological:
    - Direct Hedonism
    - Indirect Hedonism
- Prudential hedonism — the identification of one’s own good and one’s own happiness with pleasure.²² For a prudential hedonist, self-interested reasoning is about ways of maximizing pleasure; any aims that do not aim at maximizing my pleasure do not aim at my happiness or my good.
