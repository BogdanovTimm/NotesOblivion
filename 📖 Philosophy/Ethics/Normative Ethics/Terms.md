# Goods

- Goods - either final end or a step to happiness:
    - Instrumental - needed for non-instrumental goods
    - Non-instrumental - needed for themselves
    - Internal - in our control
    - External - out of our control

# Values

Selective value - what we need to choose

# Final Good

## Happiness

Happiness (eudamonia) - set of all goods:
- Adaptive Conception of Happiness - only non-instrumental goods are fullfilled desires
- Hedonistic Eudamonism:
    - set of goods consists of maximum sum of pleasures
    - set of goods consists of freedom from pain
- Aristotelian - life in accordance with human nature

### Properties of Happiness

- Comprehensive - includes all non-instrumental Goods
- Composite - includes more than 1 non-instrumental Good

## Virtues, being moral and happiness

Eudamonism - we have reason to value virtue and virtuous action as non-instrumentally good if and only if we regard them as a part of happiness.

Non-eudamonist - happiness may support being moral, though this certainly is not main reason to be moral.

Anti-eudamonist - virtues MUST not be viewed as means to happiness.

## Pleasure

Hedonism:
- current pleasures

## Virtues

- Rationalism - rational part is a primary part for virtues (though non-rational may also participate in virtues)
- Anti-rationalist - good desires is sufficient for virtues; reason plays instrumental role

## Moral

# Starting point

- Empiricism - our senses:
    - our senses of pleasure
- Dialectic - common beliefs

# Moral Psychology

- Intellectualism - we always choose the apparently greater good
- Voluntarism - we may choose bad things though we know that they are bad
