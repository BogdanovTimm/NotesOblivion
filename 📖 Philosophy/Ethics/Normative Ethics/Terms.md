# Goods

- Goods - either final end or a step to happiness:
    - Instrumental - needed for non-instrumental goods
    - Non-instrumental - needed for themselves
    - Internal - in our control
    - External - out of our control
    - Qualified - it's good only within some circumstances 
    - Unqualified - it's good in all circumstances 

# Values

Selective value - what we need to choose

# Final Good

## Happiness

Happiness (eudamonia) - set of all goods:
- Adaptive Conception of Happiness - only non-instrumental goods are fullfilled desires
- Hedonistic Eudamonism:
    - set of goods consists of maximum sum of pleasures
    - set of goods consists of freedom from pain
- Aristotelian - life in accordance with human nature

### Properties of Happiness

- Comprehensive - includes all non-instrumental Goods
- Composite - includes more than 1 non-instrumental Good

## Virtues, being moral and happiness

Eudamonism - we have reason to value virtue and virtuous action as non-instrumentally good if and only if we regard them as a part of happiness.

Non-eudamonist - happiness may support being moral, though this certainly is not main reason to be moral.

Anti-eudamonist - virtues MUST not be viewed as means to happiness.

## Pleasure

Hedonism:
- current pleasures

## Virtues

- Rationalism - rational part is a primary part for virtues (though non-rational may also participate in virtues)
- Anti-rationalist - good desires is sufficient for virtues; reason plays instrumental role

- prudence teaches us not to consent to bad inclinations
- temperance causes us not to consent to bad inclination

## Moral

# Starting point

- Empiricism - our senses:
    - our senses of pleasure
- Dialectic - common beliefs

# Moral Psychology

- Intellectualism - we always choose the apparently greater good
- Voluntarism - we may choose bad things though we know that they are bad

# Random

Kant (according to some readers) appeals to a priori truths about the abstract form of practical reason and rational agency, in abstraction from facts about actual human beings, whereas Aristotle recognizes the relevance of psychological and social facts of the sort that Kant rejects as ‘mere’ anthropology. Aristotle (on this view) is a naturalist and Kant rejects naturalism.

# Soul

- Rational Part - will
- Non-Rational Part:
    - rational desires aka boulesis
    - appetites aka concupiscent
    - spirit aka irascible

# Rationalism  vs Sentimentalism aka Anti-Rationalism

To answer Yes is to be an anti-rationalist.

To answer No is to be a rationalist. 

External reasons support Rationalism

# Intellectualism vs Voluntarism

Is the will determined by the greater good as presented by reason? 

To answer Yes is to be an intellectualist.

To answer No is to be a voluntarist.

# Reasons

- Internal - depend on agent's desires
- External - do not depend on agent's desires

# Self-love vs Justice aka Conscience 

Self-love as:
- Hedonistic - desire for pleasure
- Abstract aka structural - abstract construct, that consists of the particular desires
