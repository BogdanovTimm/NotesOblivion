# Goods

- Goods - either final end or a step to happiness:
    - Instrumental - needed for non-instrumental goods
    - Non-instrumental - needed for themselves
    - Internal - in our control
    - External - out of our control

# Final Good

## Happiness

Happiness (eudamonia) - set of all goods:
- Adaptive Conception of Happiness - only non-instrumental goods are fullfilled desires
- Hedonistic Eudamonism:
    - set of goods consists of maximum sum of pleasures
    - set of goods consists of freedom from pain
- Aristotelian - life in accordance with human nature

## Virtues, being moral and happiness

Eudamonism - we have reason to value virtue and virtuous action as non-instrumentally good if and only if we regard them as a part of happiness.

Non-eudamonist - happiness may support being moral, though this certainly is not main reason to be moral.

Anti-eudamonist - virtues MUST not be viewed as means to happiness.

## Pleasure

Hedonism:
- current pleasures

## Virtues

## Moral

# Starting point
