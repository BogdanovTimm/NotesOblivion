- Non-instrumental and overriding value of morality are true
- The rational pursuit of happiness gives us the reason that impartial justice is even more rational that pursuit of happiness
- Reid is a realist and defends independent morality, but he also sympathizes with those who treat moral knowledge as the product of a moral sense.¹⁶ He argues that reference to a moral sense supports realism and independent morality, because it explains how we can form moral judgments and claim moral knowledge of the properties that Whewell has in mind
- Reid’s version of a moral sense theory fits Whewell’s account better; for Reid’s conception of a moral sense is meant to show why we can reasonably claim knowledge of objective moral properties that are irreducible to acts of approval. From Whewell’s point of view, we might take Reid to continue the non-rationalist defence of realism that Shaftesbury began. 
- believes in a moral sense, metaphysically independent morality, and non-consequentialist morality. 
- oppose theological voluntarism.
