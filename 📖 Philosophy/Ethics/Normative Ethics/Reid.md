- Non-instrumental and overriding value of morality are true
- The rational pursuit of happiness gives us the reason that impartial justice is even more rational that pursuit of happiness
- Reid is a realist and defends independent morality, but he also sympathizes with those who treat moral knowledge as the product of a moral sense.¹⁶ He argues that reference to a moral sense supports realism and independent morality, because it explains how we can form moral judgments and claim moral knowledge of the properties that Whewell has in mind
- Reid’s version of a moral sense theory fits Whewell’s account better; for Reid’s conception of a moral sense is meant to show why we can reasonably claim knowledge of objective moral properties that are irreducible to acts of approval. From Whewell’s point of view, we might take Reid to continue the non-rationalist defence of realism that Shaftesbury began. 
- believes in a moral sense, metaphysically independent morality, and non-consequentialist morality. 
- oppose theological voluntarism.
- In Reid, the belief in intrinsic morality is separated from naturalism,
- As Reid points out later, belief in a moral sense does not push us towards realism or anti-realism until we decide how we are to conceive the relevant sort of sense.⁵³ 
- Balguy, Price, and Reid, who develop and defend Clarke’s rationalism in more detail, and examine some of the objections about moral knowledge, motivation, and justification that seem to arise for Clarke.
- If moral reasons are not derived from self-interest, they must provide suffciient reasons by themselves, without reference to any more ultimate reasons. Our recognition, for instance, that this action promotes the public good must provide—in conjunction with the relevant desire—a reason for doing it, without appeal to any further self-interested consideration. But a simple desire for the good of others for their own sake does not make someone morally good. Even if such a desire is entirely non-self-regarding, we could have it without approving of our action. It is characteristic of a morally good person, however, to approve of this desire, whether in himself or in someone else; that is the essentially reflexive element of morality. To make a moral judgment on an action is not simply to add another desire to our initial desire to do the action; it is to express the view that this desire is right and appropriate for an agent in these circumstances. A rationalist might accept these arguments. If promotion of the public good is a sufficient justification and admits no further justification, perhaps reason recognizes this justification.²⁷ Similarly, the reflexive character of moral judgment may result from rational recognition of the appropriate desire.²⁸ Butler and Reid agree with Hutcheson on the reflexive character of moral judgment. But they do not infer that moral judgments are not a product of reason.
- Reid points out that Butler’s distinction between authority and mere power is too simple.³ In cases where we appear to decide simply by consulting our stronger inclination, we may still be guided by the merits of the different options. Often we consider their merits and decide that both are acceptable, so that it is all right to go by our stronger inclination. Normally it is all right to choose Granny Smith apples over Golden Delicious simply because we prefer the taste; but if we discovered that Granny Smiths were dangerous to health, we would no longer think it all right to be guided by our taste. Reid’s point is also relevant to cases where we falsely believe we ought not to follow our stronger inclination. Perhaps, for instance, we have been told we should always drink white wine rather than red wine with fish, and so we follow this rule even though we much prefer red wine to white. If we learn that it is quite all right to drink red wine with fish, we learn that it is all right to follow our preference. Reid’s correction of Butler actually strengthens Butler’s case, since it shows that judgments of merit are relevant even in some cases where we do not explicitly refer to them. 
- pluralist intuitionist view defended by Price and Reid.⁴⁴ This view recognizes a number of ultimate principles none of which is supreme, and none of which provides any systematic reasoned basis for deciding conflicts among principles.
- Price and Reid, following Butler, reject sentimentalism, and so reject the sentimentalist argument for utilitarianism. They believe that their meta-ethical rationalism and their non-utilitarian account of justice confirm each other, and that both views rest on ordinary moral convictions. 
- Smith would be on stronger ground if he appealed to a different anti-rationalist argument, more clearly presented by Hume than by Hutcheson. According to this argument, reason itself cannot discover appropriate ends, but can only discover instrumental means to ends, and hence cannot be a source of ultimate justifying reasons. If virtues are sources of ultimate justifying reasons, reason cannot discover the virtues. The virtuous person, according to Hutcheson, regards the good of other people as worth pursuing for its own sake; but we cannot discover by reason that the good of others is worth pursuing for its own sake; and so the virtuous concern must result from something other than a discovery of reason. Reid exposes a weakness in this argument for sentimentalism: even if virtue involves a specific belief about ultimate ends, and even if this belief cannot be further justified, it does not follow that it is a sentiment.¹¹
- Smith advances this discussion through a fuller constructive account of the moral sentiments than Hume offers. He supports the sentimentalist position by describing sentiments that we might plausibly regard as the basis of our moral judgments. If he offers a descriptively adequate account that traces our various moral judgments to their sources in sentiments, he shows that sentimentalism fits the actual range and variety of moral judgments. 
- Price argues against sentimentalism by defending an epistemological position that allows us to know about objective moral properties, not simply about how we react to things that lack moral properties. Reid agrees with him in claiming that we have this sort of moral knowledge. His distinctive contribution is his discussion of questions that are less discussed by Price, on will and action. The most important parts of Active Powers concern the topics of Book ii of Hume’s Treatise, on passion, reason, and will.
Reid’s discussion reflects a conviction that he shares with Butler about the importance of moral psychology for the grasp of moral principles. He offers a full account of practical reason, will, and freewill that supports his objections to sentimentalist views in moral psychology. Butler takes moral psychology to be the centre of his argument against Hobbes;
and Reid tries to state more systematically the conception of will and practical reason that Butler accepts and that Hutcheson and Hume wrongly reject. 
- Reid connects an action’s being in our power with its being dependent on our wills. We have effective wills if and only if we have active power. 
- To clarify active power, we need to clarify the relevant notion of the will.⁷ An act of will must have an object, ‘some conception, more or less distinct, of what he wills. By this, things done voluntarily are distinguished from things done merely from instinct, or merely from habit’ (H 531b). In order to will, we must will an action that we believe to be in our power (H 532b). If this claim is taken strictly, it suggests that the agent must have a conception of itself and of its will and of things being up to it. 
- What sorts of agents meet these conditions for having wills, and therefore for having active powers? Reid’s discussion is complicated by his assumption that will does not require reason and judgment. In his chapter, ‘On the influence of incitements and motives on the will’ (H 533a), he implies that the will is not essentially rational. First, he sets aside what we do by instinct and by habit, ‘without any exercise either of judgment or will’ (H 533b).
The imputation of an action to an agent requires will.⁸ But the intervention of will does not require any judgment or reason; for in some actions ‘the will is exerted, but without judgment’ (H 533b). An example is our choice of how much to eat; Reid suggests that we are better off if we follow our tastes than if we try to work out the exact amounts and times for ourselves, and he implies that if we follow our tastes we act on will without judgment. 
- In the explanation of action Reid distinguishes:
    - mechanical principles - mechanical principles require neither attention nor deliberation nor will. They have more than mechanical principles of action, in which Reid includes instincts and habits. 
    - animal principles - it is not so clear how animal principles differ from rational. Reid believes animal principles lack judgment and reason; since deliberation seems to require judgment and reason, animal principles seem to lack deliberation.¹⁰ Hence Reid seems to imply that they require will without deliberation. A dog may be hungry, but more afraid of being beaten for eating, and so he does not eat, because ‘the strongest force prevails’. From these examples Reid concludes that will does not require judgment.¹¹ 
    - rational principles
- According to Reid, then, all voluntary actions involve an exercise of the will, but do not all involve an exercise of judgment.
Non-rational animals, children, and madmen are agents who act voluntarily, but are not accountable for their actions, because either they lack rational judgment or it is not effective in their actions (H 614b).¹³ Reid does not say that non-rational animals have wills. But he seems to imply that they have wills, if he allows that children both have wills and act on them
- An appeal to Reid’s account of will does not seem to answer this question. If he simply regarded the will as the last appetite in deliberation, as Hobbes does, and if he held Hobbes’s view of deliberation, his position would be intelligible. For non-rational agents can have a series of impulses tending in different directions; such a sequence is Hobbesian deliberation.
The strongest impulse in this series is the one that we act on; and so that, according to Hobbes, is the will.
We might argue that Hobbes’s picture is incomplete, because we need something other than appetites and desires to resolve a conflict between them; this resolution might be the task of the will. Reid rejects any such argument. For he supposes that the comparative strength of impulses is all we need to explain the choice of one option over another; we do not need to assume the ‘interposition’ of the will. 
- Such a conviction fits Reid’s account of will as ‘a power to determine, in things which he conceives to depend upon his determination’ (H 530a). Agents with wills recognize that they must make up their minds and ‘determine’ because the impulses they are aware of do not settle the question of what they should do. Such a view of the will makes it reasonable for Reid to say that impulses and desires ‘operate upon the will’ (H 551b), and that passion both ‘gives a strange bias to the judgment’ (H 571a) and ‘gives a violent impulse to the will’ (H 571b). When passion misleads us, it ‘first blinds the understanding, and then perverts the will’ (H 573a). The will seems to be distinct from appetites and desires; it is not simply the last and strongest desire in a sequence of desires. When the will is involved, I recognize that I need to decide which of these impulses, if any, I am to follow, and that it is up to me to decide which I follow. This conviction of agency seems quite different from the belief that we might ascribe to the chimpanzee trying or not trying to get the banana.¹⁵
- Some of Reid’s other remarks on the will confirm these tendencies to treat a will as requiring judgment and understanding. His contrast between desire and will suggests that the will is rational.¹⁶Sincewecanwillwhatwecannotdesire,willisnotsimplyadesire,eitherfirst-order or second-order. But it is difficult to see how a non-rational agent could act on a will that is dif-ferent from a desire. Reid, therefore, seems to assume that a will is some sort of rational state. 
- Reid seems to accept this claim that will involves judgment and a superior principle; for he connects will with accountability.¹⁹ He believes we act on the conviction that we are accountable for those actions in which we take ourselves to exercise our active powers by acting on our wills. Hence we should apparently take judgment, which is necessary for accountability, to be necessary for will.
One might reasonably suggest, therefore, that the will is moved by superior principles, and that we act on will rather than passion insofar as we are moved by consideration of the weight of reasons instead of simply registering the strength of desires. People who act wrongly under the influence of a strong passion are blameworthy if they ought to have restrained their passion; still, their action is not imputed entirely to them, but partly to the passion. Reid contrasts this case with a case of ‘perfectly’ voluntary action,²⁰ suggesting that actions may be voluntary to different degrees. An action is voluntary to the extent that it proceeds from the will, and it proceeds from the will to the extent that it proceeds from a superior principle, involving consideration of reasons rather than mere registering of strength of desires.
According to this argument, Reid ought to confine will to agents who are capable of acting on superior principles. This account of will seems to give a clearer conception of what it means to have the relevant sort of conviction that an action is in our power. We suppose that the action is up to us because we think about the merits of different courses of action, and our decision on this point determines what we do. This connexion between deliberation and active initiative is familiar in Aquinas.
This restrictive conception of the will gives Reid a strong argument against Hume’s conception. He criticizes those philosophers who take the will to include ‘not only our determination to act or not to act, but every motive and incitement to action’ (H 531a). He thinks this broad conception of will is mistaken.²¹ But he seems to invite the same objection to his view, by allowing voluntary action (explicitly) and will (less explicitly) to agents that act on these other conative states.
Reid might answer that this objection misconceives the distinction that he intends between passion and will. He compares it to the difference between advice and the ‘determination’ that we reach as a result of the advice.²² One might try to understand the division between motives and determination as the division between the impulses that incline us one way or the other, and the ‘decisive’ or effective impulse. This is Hobbes’s conception of the will as the last appetite. But this minimal understanding of ‘determination’ does not fit everything that Reid says about the will and about its connexion with the awareness of power. For we could have a ‘determining’ impulse without any awareness of the action’s being up to us, or of our having the power to determine which of our impulses we act on.
To maintain his distinction between passion and will, Reid should argue that the relevant sort of ‘determination to act or not to act’ results from rational deliberation. He agrees with bothmediaevalvoluntaristsandmediaevalrationalistswhodistinguishwillfrompassion,and so he rejects the sentimentalist tendency, derived from Hobbes, to assimilate the two. But he faces the difficulties that a voluntarist faces in recognizing the rational character of the will.
- Reid might object to our connecting will with rational deliberation; for our will is relevant to actions that are not themselves the immediate product of rational deliberation. But this does not refute the claim that the will involves practical reason and deliberation. For some actions may be voluntary because they are open to the influence of rational deliberation, even though no rational deliberation is engaged in them, and because we consent to them and thereby recognize that they are open to deliberation.²³ Reid believes that this feature of such actions makes them imputable to the agent; and he could give the same account of what makes them voluntary. He need not say that they actually express the agent’s will.
- Some of the difficulties in Reid’s position emerge in his comparison of the division between will and passion with the division between reason and passion. He agrees with both common sense and ancient philosophers in separating two parts ‘which have influence upon our voluntary determinations’. 
- Reid does not treat the will as a superior principle. The rational and non-rational parts are sources of different kinds of influence on the will and our ‘voluntary determinations’ (H 536a). Neither the rational nor the non-rational part is characteristic of, or essential to, the will. On this point his division differs from Aquinas’ description of the will as essentially rational desire (appetitus rationalis).²⁶ But his position does not seem consistent unless he holds Aquinas’ view. For he repeats his usual claim about the connexion between judgment and accountability (H 536a). If he takes will to imply accountability, he should take rational judgment to be essential to will. 
- It is difficult, however to express the essential connexion between reason and will. Reid wantstosaythatwecanactonourwillwithoutbeingguidedbytherationalpart.Insuchcases we might say that we deliberately refuse to follow the superior principle that we recognize.
One might ask how something that is essentially rational could refuse to follow reason.
Reid suggests an answer to this question (though he does not apply it directly to his description of the will). In some cases we seem to choose simply by inclination, as when we choose between cheese and lobster. But he argues that our choice does not result simply from inclination; we correctly believe it is all right to follow inclination because we judge that the two tastes are equally good and that it is reasonable to follow inclination instead of trying to reason about which to prefer (H 534b). Rational judgment tells us how to decide the first-order question about which action to prefer.
An application of this pattern might help to explain how the will, while being essentially rational, can reject reason. We may reach a rational, even if mistaken, conclusion that in this case it is all right to follow passion without reflecting further on the merits of the course of action that our passion inclines us to do. This way of understanding will explains how Reid can distinguish it from the influence of practical reason, but also insist on its connexion with accountability, which requires judgment.
- Reid’s further remarks about the will make his position no less perplexing. He distinguishes mechanical, animal, and rational principles of action. Mechanical principles require no will or intention; animal principles require will and intention, but not judgment; and rational principles require judgment (H 558a, 579b, 580a, 599b). While everyone acknowledges mech-anical and animal principles, some philosophers deny any rational principles. Reid sets out to show that we must recognize them. Since animal principles do not require the reason and judgment that are characteristic of human agents, they belong to other animals too (H 551b).
Itisparticularlydifficulttoseewhathemeansbyclaimingthattheoperationofanimalprin-ciples requires will and intention. These principles are present in non-rational animals as well as rational; does Reid mean that in non-rational animals will and intention are involved in the operation of animal principles? It is difficult to see why they should be. For in rational agents willandpassionaredistinct;passionsprovidemotivesandcaninfluencethewill,butReiddoes not believe that they are effective only when will endorses them. If they can move rational agents independently of will, why can they not move non-rational agents in the same way?
When Reid claims that the operation of animal principles involves will, he might not be referring to non-rational agents. He might mean that we normally act voluntarily when we act on animal principles, since normally we are accountable for how we act on animal principles. If we are accountable, will is involved, since will is the source of accountability.
But if he has this role in mind for will, he cannot reasonably separate will from judgment;
for, as we have seen, he takes accountability to vary with the role of judgment in an action.
Reid’s discussion of animal principles corresponds to Aquinas’ discussion of the passions, but in one respect it is inferior to Aquinas. Reid ought to explain how animal principles are the source of some of the voluntary actions for which we are accountable. Aquinas explains this by appeal to the consent of the will, understood as essentially rational desire.
Reid follows him in taking accountability to require some role for the will, but he does not explicitly describe the will as essentially rational. 
- We can perhaps clarify some of Reid’s views about will and reason if we turn to his explicit discussion of action on rational principles. He follows Butler in ascribing superiority and authority to these principles.²⁷ Acting on rational principles involves some sort of judgment.
But evidently not every sort of judgment will do. If we act on purely instrumental reasoning about ways to satisfy a particular appetite, we do not necessarily act on a rational principle. We recognize an authoritative principle insofar as we recognize that some consideration apart from the strength of my desire favours one course of action over another. Sometimes one appetite may be restrained by a stronger contrary appetite, as in the earlier example of a hungry dog who leaves his food alone from fear of punishment; the dog does not act on a superior principle.²⁸ Reid suggests that without superior principles non-rational agents yield passively to the stronger impulse; he returns to the connexion between will and active power. Though he does not say that acting on our will is acting on a superior principle, he attributes the common character of active, rather than passive, reaction to both of them. Moreover, an authoritative principle tends to provoke self-approval (if we follow it) and shame or remorse (if we violate it).²⁹ Our reactions to such a principle rest on the considerations that underlie it. Since we think we have some reason to follow it apart from our desire for the end that it enjoins, we have some basis for reproaching ourselves. We do not simply notice that our predominant desire in the past is no longer predominant.
So far Reid follows Butler. He exploits this conception of a superior principle in order to defend a conception of rational self-love that is not explicitly present in Butler. He sees that when Butler speaks of superior principles and claims that they are in accordance with the agent’s nature, he is not simply explaining what he means by ‘superior principle’ or ‘nature’. On the contrary, Butler claims that acting on principles that consider value as well as psychological strength fits our nature as temporally extended agents.
