- Non-instrumental and overriding value of morality are true
- The rational pursuit of happiness gives us the reason that impartial justice is even more rational that pursuit of happiness
- Reid is a realist and defends independent morality, but he also sympathizes with those who treat moral knowledge as the product of a moral sense.¹⁶ He argues that reference to a moral sense supports realism and independent morality, because it explains how we can form moral judgments and claim moral knowledge of the properties that Whewell has in mind
- Reid’s version of a moral sense theory fits Whewell’s account better; for Reid’s conception of a moral sense is meant to show why we can reasonably claim knowledge of objective moral properties that are irreducible to acts of approval. From Whewell’s point of view, we might take Reid to continue the non-rationalist defence of realism that Shaftesbury began. 
- believes in a moral sense, metaphysically independent morality, and non-consequentialist morality. 
- oppose theological voluntarism.
- In Reid, the belief in intrinsic morality is separated from naturalism,
- As Reid points out later, belief in a moral sense does not push us towards realism or anti-realism until we decide how we are to conceive the relevant sort of sense.⁵³ 
- Balguy, Price, and Reid, who develop and defend Clarke’s rationalism in more detail, and examine some of the objections about moral knowledge, motivation, and justification that seem to arise for Clarke.
- If moral reasons are not derived from self-interest, they must provide suffciient reasons by themselves, without reference to any more ultimate reasons. Our recognition, for instance, that this action promotes the public good must provide—in conjunction with the relevant desire—a reason for doing it, without appeal to any further self-interested consideration. But a simple desire for the good of others for their own sake does not make someone morally good. Even if such a desire is entirely non-self-regarding, we could have it without approving of our action. It is characteristic of a morally good person, however, to approve of this desire, whether in himself or in someone else; that is the essentially reflexive element of morality. To make a moral judgment on an action is not simply to add another desire to our initial desire to do the action; it is to express the view that this desire is right and appropriate for an agent in these circumstances. A rationalist might accept these arguments. If promotion of the public good is a sufficient justification and admits no further justification, perhaps reason recognizes this justification.²⁷ Similarly, the reflexive character of moral judgment may result from rational recognition of the appropriate desire.²⁸ Butler and Reid agree with Hutcheson on the reflexive character of moral judgment. But they do not infer that moral judgments are not a product of reason.
- Reid points out that Butler’s distinction between authority and mere power is too simple.³ In cases where we appear to decide simply by consulting our stronger inclination, we may still be guided by the merits of the different options. Often we consider their merits and decide that both are acceptable, so that it is all right to go by our stronger inclination. Normally it is all right to choose Granny Smith apples over Golden Delicious simply because we prefer the taste; but if we discovered that Granny Smiths were dangerous to health, we would no longer think it all right to be guided by our taste. Reid’s point is also relevant to cases where we falsely believe we ought not to follow our stronger inclination. Perhaps, for instance, we have been told we should always drink white wine rather than red wine with fish, and so we follow this rule even though we much prefer red wine to white. If we learn that it is quite all right to drink red wine with fish, we learn that it is all right to follow our preference. Reid’s correction of Butler actually strengthens Butler’s case, since it shows that judgments of merit are relevant even in some cases where we do not explicitly refer to them. 
- pluralist intuitionist view defended by Price and Reid.⁴⁴ This view recognizes a number of ultimate principles none of which is supreme, and none of which provides any systematic reasoned basis for deciding conflicts among principles.
- Price and Reid, following Butler, reject sentimentalism, and so reject the sentimentalist argument for utilitarianism. They believe that their meta-ethical rationalism and their non-utilitarian account of justice confirm each other, and that both views rest on ordinary moral convictions. 
- Smith would be on stronger ground if he appealed to a different anti-rationalist argument, more clearly presented by Hume than by Hutcheson. According to this argument, reason itself cannot discover appropriate ends, but can only discover instrumental means to ends, and hence cannot be a source of ultimate justifying reasons. If virtues are sources of ultimate justifying reasons, reason cannot discover the virtues. The virtuous person, according to Hutcheson, regards the good of other people as worth pursuing for its own sake; but we cannot discover by reason that the good of others is worth pursuing for its own sake; and so the virtuous concern must result from something other than a discovery of reason. Reid exposes a weakness in this argument for sentimentalism: even if virtue involves a specific belief about ultimate ends, and even if this belief cannot be further justified, it does not follow that it is a sentiment.¹¹
- Smith advances this discussion through a fuller constructive account of the moral sentiments than Hume offers. He supports the sentimentalist position by describing sentiments that we might plausibly regard as the basis of our moral judgments. If he offers a descriptively adequate account that traces our various moral judgments to their sources in sentiments, he shows that sentimentalism fits the actual range and variety of moral judgments. 
- Price argues against sentimentalism by defending an epistemological position that allows us to know about objective moral properties, not simply about how we react to things that lack moral properties. Reid agrees with him in claiming that we have this sort of moral knowledge. His distinctive contribution is his discussion of questions that are less discussed by Price, on will and action. The most important parts of Active Powers concern the topics of Book ii of Hume’s Treatise, on passion, reason, and will.
Reid’s discussion reflects a conviction that he shares with Butler about the importance of moral psychology for the grasp of moral principles. He offers a full account of practical reason, will, and freewill that supports his objections to sentimentalist views in moral psychology. Butler takes moral psychology to be the centre of his argument against Hobbes;
and Reid tries to state more systematically the conception of will and practical reason that Butler accepts and that Hutcheson and Hume wrongly reject. 
- Reid connects an action’s being in our power with its being dependent on our wills. We have effective wills if and only if we have active power. 
- To clarify active power, we need to clarify the relevant notion of the will.⁷ An act of will must have an object, ‘some conception, more or less distinct, of what he wills. By this, things done voluntarily are distinguished from things done merely from instinct, or merely from habit’ (H 531b). In order to will, we must will an action that we believe to be in our power (H 532b). If this claim is taken strictly, it suggests that the agent must have a conception of itself and of its will and of things being up to it. 
- What sorts of agents meet these conditions for having wills, and therefore for having active powers? Reid’s discussion is complicated by his assumption that will does not require reason and judgment. In his chapter, ‘On the influence of incitements and motives on the will’ (H 533a), he implies that the will is not essentially rational. First, he sets aside what we do by instinct and by habit, ‘without any exercise either of judgment or will’ (H 533b).
The imputation of an action to an agent requires will.⁸ But the intervention of will does not require any judgment or reason; for in some actions ‘the will is exerted, but without judgment’ (H 533b). An example is our choice of how much to eat; Reid suggests that we are better off if we follow our tastes than if we try to work out the exact amounts and times for ourselves, and he implies that if we follow our tastes we act on will without judgment. 
- In the explanation of action Reid distinguishes:
    - mechanical principles - mechanical principles require neither attention nor deliberation nor will. They have more than mechanical principles of action, in which Reid includes instincts and habits. 
    - animal principles - it is not so clear how animal principles differ from rational. Reid believes animal principles lack judgment and reason; since deliberation seems to require judgment and reason, animal principles seem to lack deliberation.¹⁰ Hence Reid seems to imply that they require will without deliberation. A dog may be hungry, but more afraid of being beaten for eating, and so he does not eat, because ‘the strongest force prevails’. From these examples Reid concludes that will does not require judgment.¹¹ 
    - rational principles
- According to Reid, then, all voluntary actions involve an exercise of the will, but do not all involve an exercise of judgment.
Non-rational animals, children, and madmen are agents who act voluntarily, but are not accountable for their actions, because either they lack rational judgment or it is not effective in their actions (H 614b).¹³ Reid does not say that non-rational animals have wills. But he seems to imply that they have wills, if he allows that children both have wills and act on them
- An appeal to Reid’s account of will does not seem to answer this question. If he simply regarded the will as the last appetite in deliberation, as Hobbes does, and if he held Hobbes’s view of deliberation, his position would be intelligible. For non-rational agents can have a series of impulses tending in different directions; such a sequence is Hobbesian deliberation.
The strongest impulse in this series is the one that we act on; and so that, according to Hobbes, is the will.
We might argue that Hobbes’s picture is incomplete, because we need something other than appetites and desires to resolve a conflict between them; this resolution might be the task of the will. Reid rejects any such argument. For he supposes that the comparative strength of impulses is all we need to explain the choice of one option over another; we do not need to assume the ‘interposition’ of the will. 
- Such a conviction fits Reid’s account of will as ‘a power to determine, in things which he conceives to depend upon his determination’ (H 530a). Agents with wills recognize that they must make up their minds and ‘determine’ because the impulses they are aware of do not settle the question of what they should do. Such a view of the will makes it reasonable for Reid to say that impulses and desires ‘operate upon the will’ (H 551b), and that passion both ‘gives a strange bias to the judgment’ (H 571a) and ‘gives a violent impulse to the will’ (H 571b). When passion misleads us, it ‘first blinds the understanding, and then perverts the will’ (H 573a). The will seems to be distinct from appetites and desires; it is not simply the last and strongest desire in a sequence of desires. When the will is involved, I recognize that I need to decide which of these impulses, if any, I am to follow, and that it is up to me to decide which I follow. This conviction of agency seems quite different from the belief that we might ascribe to the chimpanzee trying or not trying to get the banana.¹⁵
- Some of Reid’s other remarks on the will confirm these tendencies to treat a will as requiring judgment and understanding. His contrast between desire and will suggests that the will is rational.¹⁶Sincewecanwillwhatwecannotdesire,willisnotsimplyadesire,eitherfirst-order or second-order. But it is difficult to see how a non-rational agent could act on a will that is dif-ferent from a desire. Reid, therefore, seems to assume that a will is some sort of rational state. 
- Reid seems to accept this claim that will involves judgment and a superior principle; for he connects will with accountability.¹⁹ He believes we act on the conviction that we are accountable for those actions in which we take ourselves to exercise our active powers by acting on our wills. Hence we should apparently take judgment, which is necessary for accountability, to be necessary for will.
One might reasonably suggest, therefore, that the will is moved by superior principles, and that we act on will rather than passion insofar as we are moved by consideration of the weight of reasons instead of simply registering the strength of desires. People who act wrongly under the influence of a strong passion are blameworthy if they ought to have restrained their passion; still, their action is not imputed entirely to them, but partly to the passion. Reid contrasts this case with a case of ‘perfectly’ voluntary action,²⁰ suggesting that actions may be voluntary to different degrees. An action is voluntary to the extent that it proceeds from the will, and it proceeds from the will to the extent that it proceeds from a superior principle, involving consideration of reasons rather than mere registering of strength of desires.
According to this argument, Reid ought to confine will to agents who are capable of acting on superior principles. This account of will seems to give a clearer conception of what it means to have the relevant sort of conviction that an action is in our power. We suppose that the action is up to us because we think about the merits of different courses of action, and our decision on this point determines what we do. This connexion between deliberation and active initiative is familiar in Aquinas.
This restrictive conception of the will gives Reid a strong argument against Hume’s conception. He criticizes those philosophers who take the will to include ‘not only our determination to act or not to act, but every motive and incitement to action’ (H 531a). He thinks this broad conception of will is mistaken.²¹ But he seems to invite the same objection to his view, by allowing voluntary action (explicitly) and will (less explicitly) to agents that act on these other conative states.
Reid might answer that this objection misconceives the distinction that he intends between passion and will. He compares it to the difference between advice and the ‘determination’ that we reach as a result of the advice.²² One might try to understand the division between motives and determination as the division between the impulses that incline us one way or the other, and the ‘decisive’ or effective impulse. This is Hobbes’s conception of the will as the last appetite. But this minimal understanding of ‘determination’ does not fit everything that Reid says about the will and about its connexion with the awareness of power. For we could have a ‘determining’ impulse without any awareness of the action’s being up to us, or of our having the power to determine which of our impulses we act on.
To maintain his distinction between passion and will, Reid should argue that the relevant sort of ‘determination to act or not to act’ results from rational deliberation. He agrees with bothmediaevalvoluntaristsandmediaevalrationalistswhodistinguishwillfrompassion,and so he rejects the sentimentalist tendency, derived from Hobbes, to assimilate the two. But he faces the difficulties that a voluntarist faces in recognizing the rational character of the will.
- Reid might object to our connecting will with rational deliberation; for our will is relevant to actions that are not themselves the immediate product of rational deliberation. But this does not refute the claim that the will involves practical reason and deliberation. For some actions may be voluntary because they are open to the influence of rational deliberation, even though no rational deliberation is engaged in them, and because we consent to them and thereby recognize that they are open to deliberation.²³ Reid believes that this feature of such actions makes them imputable to the agent; and he could give the same account of what makes them voluntary. He need not say that they actually express the agent’s will.
- Some of the difficulties in Reid’s position emerge in his comparison of the division between will and passion with the division between reason and passion. He agrees with both common sense and ancient philosophers in separating two parts ‘which have influence upon our voluntary determinations’. 
- Reid does not treat the will as a superior principle. The rational and non-rational parts are sources of different kinds of influence on the will and our ‘voluntary determinations’ (H 536a). Neither the rational nor the non-rational part is characteristic of, or essential to, the will. On this point his division differs from Aquinas’ description of the will as essentially rational desire (appetitus rationalis).²⁶ But his position does not seem consistent unless he holds Aquinas’ view. For he repeats his usual claim about the connexion between judgment and accountability (H 536a). If he takes will to imply accountability, he should take rational judgment to be essential to will. 
- It is difficult, however to express the essential connexion between reason and will. Reid wantstosaythatwecanactonourwillwithoutbeingguidedbytherationalpart.Insuchcases we might say that we deliberately refuse to follow the superior principle that we recognize.
One might ask how something that is essentially rational could refuse to follow reason.
Reid suggests an answer to this question (though he does not apply it directly to his description of the will). In some cases we seem to choose simply by inclination, as when we choose between cheese and lobster. But he argues that our choice does not result simply from inclination; we correctly believe it is all right to follow inclination because we judge that the two tastes are equally good and that it is reasonable to follow inclination instead of trying to reason about which to prefer (H 534b). Rational judgment tells us how to decide the first-order question about which action to prefer.
An application of this pattern might help to explain how the will, while being essentially rational, can reject reason. We may reach a rational, even if mistaken, conclusion that in this case it is all right to follow passion without reflecting further on the merits of the course of action that our passion inclines us to do. This way of understanding will explains how Reid can distinguish it from the influence of practical reason, but also insist on its connexion with accountability, which requires judgment.
- Reid’s further remarks about the will make his position no less perplexing. He distinguishes mechanical, animal, and rational principles of action. Mechanical principles require no will or intention; animal principles require will and intention, but not judgment; and rational principles require judgment (H 558a, 579b, 580a, 599b). While everyone acknowledges mech-anical and animal principles, some philosophers deny any rational principles. Reid sets out to show that we must recognize them. Since animal principles do not require the reason and judgment that are characteristic of human agents, they belong to other animals too (H 551b).
Itisparticularlydifficulttoseewhathemeansbyclaimingthattheoperationofanimalprin-ciples requires will and intention. These principles are present in non-rational animals as well as rational; does Reid mean that in non-rational animals will and intention are involved in the operation of animal principles? It is difficult to see why they should be. For in rational agents willandpassionaredistinct;passionsprovidemotivesandcaninfluencethewill,butReiddoes not believe that they are effective only when will endorses them. If they can move rational agents independently of will, why can they not move non-rational agents in the same way?
When Reid claims that the operation of animal principles involves will, he might not be referring to non-rational agents. He might mean that we normally act voluntarily when we act on animal principles, since normally we are accountable for how we act on animal principles. If we are accountable, will is involved, since will is the source of accountability.
But if he has this role in mind for will, he cannot reasonably separate will from judgment;
for, as we have seen, he takes accountability to vary with the role of judgment in an action.
Reid’s discussion of animal principles corresponds to Aquinas’ discussion of the passions, but in one respect it is inferior to Aquinas. Reid ought to explain how animal principles are the source of some of the voluntary actions for which we are accountable. Aquinas explains this by appeal to the consent of the will, understood as essentially rational desire.
Reid follows him in taking accountability to require some role for the will, but he does not explicitly describe the will as essentially rational. 
- We can perhaps clarify some of Reid’s views about will and reason if we turn to his explicit discussion of action on rational principles. He follows Butler in ascribing superiority and authority to these principles.²⁷ Acting on rational principles involves some sort of judgment.
But evidently not every sort of judgment will do. If we act on purely instrumental reasoning about ways to satisfy a particular appetite, we do not necessarily act on a rational principle. We recognize an authoritative principle insofar as we recognize that some consideration apart from the strength of my desire favours one course of action over another. Sometimes one appetite may be restrained by a stronger contrary appetite, as in the earlier example of a hungry dog who leaves his food alone from fear of punishment; the dog does not act on a superior principle.²⁸ Reid suggests that without superior principles non-rational agents yield passively to the stronger impulse; he returns to the connexion between will and active power. Though he does not say that acting on our will is acting on a superior principle, he attributes the common character of active, rather than passive, reaction to both of them. Moreover, an authoritative principle tends to provoke self-approval (if we follow it) and shame or remorse (if we violate it).²⁹ Our reactions to such a principle rest on the considerations that underlie it. Since we think we have some reason to follow it apart from our desire for the end that it enjoins, we have some basis for reproaching ourselves. We do not simply notice that our predominant desire in the past is no longer predominant.
So far Reid follows Butler. He exploits this conception of a superior principle in order to defend a conception of rational self-love that is not explicitly present in Butler. He sees that when Butler speaks of superior principles and claims that they are in accordance with the agent’s nature, he is not simply explaining what he means by ‘superior principle’ or ‘nature’. On the contrary, Butler claims that acting on principles that consider value as well as psychological strength fits our nature as temporally extended agents. 
- Reid points out that superior principles reflect our conception of our good on the whole, which results from our conception of ourselves as temporally extended agents whose good is to be considered. Since we are temporally extended agents, we have interests that cannot be achieved by simply following the stronger current impulse; and so we discover that in our own interest we have to follow principles that rely on authority rather than mere strength.³⁰ In Reid’s view, this account of superior principles and of self-love is not his innovation or Butler’s. It captures arguments that lead Greek moralists to recognize an ultimate end that underlies all rational desire.³¹ This comparison with Butler and with the eudaemonism of Aristotle and Aquinas is appropriate, but it does not fit Reid’s view of the will. Aquinas presents his theory of the will as a simplifying and unifying account of (1) the difference between will and passion; (2) conditions for responsibility; (3) the necessity of the pursuit of happiness. All of these questions are answered by Aquinas’ account of the will, because the will is an essentially rational desire that is focussed on the pursuit of the ultimate end that is happiness, and because we are responsible for actions in which our desire for happiness has some causal role.³² This is not how Reid explains his position. While he takes will to be necessary for responsibility, he does not take it to involve the desire (confined to agents with rational principles) for one’s good as a whole. Hence he does not believe that responsibility involves a causal role for this desire. He differs from Aquinas on this point partly because he does not always take the will to be essentially rational. This disagreement with Aquinas carries a cost for Reid. He agrees with Aquinas in taking the will to be essentially connected with responsibility. But he also takes judgment to be necessary for responsibility. Aquinas agrees on both points, and explains the connexion between them, by taking will to require rational judgment (appropriately understood). Reid does not explain the connexion in this way. By failing to explain it, he leaves obscure the roles of will and judgment in responsibility. 
- Some of the obscurities in Reid’s conception of the will are easier to explain if we turn to his views about the freedom of the will, which he takes to be incompatible with determinism.
His argument for indeterminism rests on our convictions about agency, which he takes to conflict with the truth of causal determinism.
He assumes we have a conviction of liberty as an agent’s ‘power over the determination of his own will’ (599a). But he adds a second condition on freedom, rejecting necessitation.³³ This condition seems to tell us that the relevant power comes only from ourselves. But why should we need this information? If the source of the power is not wholly within ourselves, why should we abandon our claim to have the power?
Reid answers that the two conditions, referring to the possession of the power and to its source, are not really separate; the requirement of power implies the absence of necessitation. He argues that if we have the power to do x here and now, we must have all the means necessary for doing x.³⁴ If we would not have done x without the occurrence of some event that happened before we were born, we lack the power to do x.³⁵ Once we recognize what follows from our being genuine agents and active causes with the power to produce effects, we can see that indeterminism is true. 
- These arguments about liberty introduce a new element in Reid’s views on will and responsibility. So far we have found reasons to ascribe three views to him: 
    - According to his broad view, acting on will is necessary and sufficient for accountability. In one place he says that ‘the free determinations of his own will’ are attributed to the agent,³⁶ but immediately afterwards he speaks of actions that are ‘subject to the will’ and ‘what is done by his conscious will and intention’³⁷ as attributable to the agent. 
    - According to a more restrictive view, actions are attributable to the agent to the extent that they proceed from will and judgment. These actions are ‘perfectly voluntary’ and the whole guilt is attributed to the agent (73).³⁸ 
    - According to the most restrictive view, actions are attributable to the agent only if they proceed from will and judgment and are done freely. This is the account of responsibility that Reid defends in his arguments about liberty. When he defends the most restrictive view, Reid suggests that some actions proceeding from will and judgment may not be attributable to the agent, because they are not free.³⁹ In order to show that will does not imply accountability, Reid cites actions dependent on will for which the agent is not accountable. From these cases he argues that freedom is an additional condition for accountability, not automatically satisfied by actions dependent on will.
One might reasonably doubt, however, whether in these cases we take a person’s action to proceed from his will without accountability. Reid mentions the actions of brute animals, children, madmen, and people acting on irresistible motives (H 614b, 619a). But if we really believe that these motives and emotions are irresistible, we need not agree that when we act on them we act on our will. In such cases we seem to act as non-rational animals do;
we are moved simply by the strongest desire (H 534a),⁴⁰ where ‘strongest’ is taken to imply ‘animal strength’, as Reid explains it (H 611a).⁴¹
- Reid claims that even when we act solely on the strongest animal motive, and when this motive is so strong that we are not accountable for acting on it, our will is engaged. But he does not give a good reason for introducing the will. The will seems to have no distinct explanatory role in the process that Reid conceives as simply an interplay of forces. The mere fact that the process reaches some ‘determination’ does not show that we need anything more than a Hobbesian ‘last appetite’; it does not show that we have the determinative power that Reid ascribes to a will. Hence it is not clear that action on irresistible passions and emotions engages the will; hence these actions do not show that will is insufficient for accountability.
If, then, the will is involved in fewer actions than Reid supposes, his examples do not involve will, and hence they do not show that accountability requires freedom in addition to will and judgment. If we are convinced that will and judgment have the appropriate causal role in someone’s actions, we have a good reason for taking the agent to be accountable for the actions. In speaking of an ‘appropriate’ causal role for will and judgment, we may appear to be evading the issue that Reid raises, about the character of the appropriate causal role. Still, we seem to be entitled to recognize a causal role for our will and judgment that falls short of freedom, as Reid conceives it. When Reid takes freedom to be a further condition, he suggests that our actions might ‘depend on’ will and judgment, even if we are not free in performing those actions. But his remarks about will, judgment, and accountability suggest that dependence on will and judgment implies accountability.
- Reid might answer us by pointing out that we take will to be relevant to accountability because we take it to involve the exercise of active power. But we cannot exercise active power, in his view, if we are necessitated. In claiming that we ourselves are the agents of our actions, we deny that our actions result from a deterministic process that results from events outside us and our will. If our actions resulted from such a deterministic process, the agents responsible for our actions (if any) would be external to us, and we ourselves would not exercise active power (280).
Reid takes seriously the claim that we ourselves are the causes of our actions. He takes it to require a doctrine of agent causation, so that, strictly speaking, the cause of our actions is ourselves, not some event, process, or state in us.⁴² Though he recognizes that we use ‘cause’ in looser senses that do not require the complete causal self-sufficiency of a cause or agent, he believes that the strict sense fits our convictions about our agency, and hence about our accountability.
These claims raise a difficulty for Reid. He admits that we habitually use ‘cause’ and ‘agent’ loosely, so that we do not always take them to imply his strict conditions. How, then, does he know that our experience of agency, formed by our deliberate and voluntary action, is a conviction that we are causes in his strict sense, and not only in the looser sense consistent with necessitation?⁴³
- It is difficult even to understand Reid’s strong conception of power. Some restriction on its apparent scope seems to be needed. We normally suppose that we have the power to move a pen or kick a football. We lack a necessary means, however, for exercising this power unless the pen and the football exist. Their existence may not be in our power; it is not in our power to create all the instruments we use, still less to create them immediately before we use them. In any case, our own existence is presumably a necessary condition of our exercising any power, but it is not itself in our power.
Reid might reply that we do not really have the power to kick a football, but only have the power to move our foot in a particular way or (since the existence of our foot and its connexion to our brain are not in our power) to make a certain kind of choice that can be described without reference to a foot or a football. But his position is actually more complicated. He concedes that there may be intermediary processes of which we are ignorant, coming between our decision to raise our arm and the rising of our arm.⁴⁴ His treatment of ‘indirect causation’ seems relevant to questions about determinism. For here he admits that my responsibility for shooting my neighbour does not depend on my act of will’s being sufficient, all by itself, for his being shot. The shooting must somehow appropriately depend on my will. It may be difficult to describe this dependence precisely, but Reid has good reason to claim that we can recognize an appropriate causal connexion that carries accountability.⁴⁵ Why, then, might we not take the same view about the causal sequence that precedes the contribution of my will? If I deliberately will to shoot my neighbour and set in motion the train of events that I believe will result in the shooting, am I not accountable for shooting him, even if I am not the only cause of my deliberate will? Reid suggests, quite reasonably, that we need not be concerned, for purposes of responsibility, about whether other unknown processes intervene between my will and the shooting. Why, then, should we not be similarly indifferent to whether my will is ultimately the outcome of unknown deterministic processes? Even if the ultimate determinant of my neighbour’s being shot is some sequence of events in the early history of the universe, that does not affect the fact that my will contributes causally to the shooting.
Reid might reply that our will is taken to fix responsibility only in cases where it is the exercise of the appropriate sort of power. If I want to score a goal, and I am a skilled footballer, but no one will play football, I cannot in these circumstances score a goal. I cannot exercise my ability (as we might call it⁴⁶) to score a goal in the present circumstances unless the present circumstances make it possible for me to do something that leads to my scoring a goal; and so I might say that I lack the power to score a goal. 
- But this requirement (that if I am able to do x here and now, circumstances must make it possible to do something that leads to doing x) falls far short of Reid’s demand for an absolutely self-sufficient power that depends on no antecedent conditions external to the agent. Why, then, should we ever ascribe to ourselves the sort of absolutely self-sufficient power that he mentions? If we do not think we have absolutely self-sufficient power, his argument from our conviction of power to the truth of indeterminism must collapse. 
- The same objection faces Reid’s appeal to our convictions about causation. He argues:
(1) We think we are the causes of our actions. (2) A genuine cause must be an undetermined cause. (3) Hence the truth of our conviction in (1) rests on the truth of indeterminism.
The weakness in Reid’s argument lies in his effort to combine his first two claims. Let us grant the second claim for the sake of argument, and allow that the only genuine cause is an undetermined cause. But is this the sense of ‘cause’ that properly applies to the common-sense conviction stated in the first claim? In believing that we are causes, do we believe that we are undetermined causes? 
- Reid admits that we tend to use ‘cause’ loosely so that it applies to determined (let us call them) ‘quasi-causes’. Why, then, should we not suppose that when we believe we are causes, we use ‘causes’ to refer to quasi-causes? If Reid could show that we hold the views about power and ability that require us to be undetermined causes, he would be entitled to claim that we take ourselves—implicitly at least—to be undetermined causes. But his arguments to show that we attribute absolutely self-sufficient power to ourselves are open to objection.
Reid argues that we have a firm belief in freedom that cannot be uprooted by any doctrine of necessity, even in those who find the doctrine convincing (H 616b, 618a). His observation is a legitimate objection against any ‘hard’ determinist (someone who combines incompatibilism with determinism). But it is an argument for his indeterminist position only if our conviction conflicts with the truth of determinism. To show that it conflicts with determinism, Reid must rely on the arguments about causation and power that we have previously disputed. He cannot claim the support of common sense and universal conviction for his indeterminist analysis of freedom and power. 
- Reid is right to suppose that obligation and responsibility presuppose that the agent is in some sense the cause of the good or bad action and that in some sense it is possible for the agent to do or not to do the action. But what are the relevant senses of ‘cause’ and ‘possible’? Reid is entitled to rely on our convictions about accountability and obligation only if he can show that they rely on his strongest conditions for causation and possibility.
But he has not shown this. Admittedly, we do not blame agents for actions that their beliefs and values seem not to affect, or for actions on beliefs and values that seem to have been formed in the wrong way. But when we praise or blame people, we do not explicitly assume that their choices are not caused by any previous events.⁵⁰ We do not try to assure ourselves about the absence of external causation, and we do not change our minds about the agent’s responsibility simply because we learn a causal account of the origin of the agent’s values.
Indeed, one of Reid’s favourite arguments from common sense seems to work against him here. When he discusses intermediate causes (in ascribing responsibility for shooting one’s neighbour), he assumes that our knowledge, will, and intention are decisive, and that the causal mechanisms by which they achieve their effects do not matter for purposes of accountability. We might reasonably argue that this is also the point of view of common sense on determinism; we are interested in the role of our will and intention and not in all the processes by which our will and intention came about. Instead of claiming that our intuitive convictions about agency exclude the truth of determinism, Reid would be better advised to claim that they are indifferent to determinism. 
- He argues that we can draw a distinction between capricious and non-capricious action even if we reject determinism for human actions.⁵² He suggests that someone who resists animal motives ‘when duty requires’ is a good person. But apparently the mere conjunction suggested by ‘when’ does not make someone a good person. We also require a good person to resist animal motives because duty requires. If my recognition that duty requires this action does not explain my doing this action, I am not a good person; but my recognition that duty requires it does not seem to explain my action unless it is a causal determinant of the action. Reid has not explained how the causal claims involved in our judgment of a person’s character can be justified without belief in causal determination. 
- But this general principle casts doubt on Reid’s attempt to derive indeterminism from common-sense judgments about responsibility no less than it casts doubt on any determinist attempt to argue from common-sense judgments about character. 
- Reid believes that agents choose the courses of action that make them virtuous or vicious.
Why do they do this? An intellectualist account of the will argues that the vicious person has made a mistake about the good, and has chosen some apparent or partial good that appeared to him to be the right way to secure his ultimate good. Reid rejects the determinist assumptions of this view; for he thinks the will must be free to choose for or against the greater apparent good. He agrees that we are accountable for this choice, and therefore we make it freely. To explain how we make the choice, he asks what people will do if they have the freedom that he attributes to them. He assumes that wise people may be expected to choose the greater long-term good over the immediately pleasant.⁵³ But what justifies this expectation? If the will is likely to pick the pleasant or the overall good, these two objects are likely to seem attractive; but whether they are attractive or not seems to depend on what sorts of considerations actually determine the will. If nothing determines the will, we have no reason to expect that these will be the most likely objects of choice. 
- But if Reid is right, ought we to assume that an agent’s choice of immediate pleasure in preference to overall good betrays foolishness? If the will were determined by our judgment of what is best, failure to choose what is best would show lack of understanding.
But if the will can recognize what is best, and still choose something else, the choice of something else does not seem to be evidence of foolishness. Reid does not seem entitled to his assumptions about wisdom and folly. 
- In supposing that an undetermined choice underlies claims about accountability, Reid seems to undermine the conception of choice that allows it to play a role in judgments about accountability. Normally we think an agent’s choice matters because we think it is made in the light of considerations, and we suppose that these considerations are the appropriate or inappropriate ones to determine an agent’s actions. But a choice that is not based on, or determined by, anything at all does not seem important for judgments about accountability.
Reid has not described a credible alternative to an intellectualist conception of the will. Though he claims that intellectualism cannot explain freedom and accountability, the alternative conception he offers is unsatisfactory. It should prompt us to ask whether the objections to the intellectualist view are as decisive as he thinks they are. Reid’s indeterminism is not justified by our beliefs about freedom and responsibility. 
- The convictions that he seeks to enlist in support of his position give stronger support to Aquinas. 
- Though Reid does not follow Aquinas in taking the desire for happiness to be the distinguishing feature of a free agent, his conception of it makes it quite suitable for that role.
His views about happiness are closer to those of the Greek and mediaeval moralists than to those of his immediate predecessors; he is an exception to the general tendency to accept a hedonist conception of self-love and happiness.⁵⁴ He gives a much fairer account of the Greek conception of happiness than we find in his predecessors. He therefore corrects some of Butler’s and Price’s claims about happiness and one’s own good, so that Reid’s conception of reasonable self-love is more suitable than Butler’s own conception for the role that Butler has in mind for self-love.⁵⁵
- Sidgwick is right, then, to claim that Reid does not speak of self-love and one’s own good in purely hedonist terms. He is wrong, however, to suggest that Reid’s view of the object of self-love is vague or inconsistent. Reid seems to conceive it consistently as one’s own good, which includes more than pleasure. Sidgwick perhaps supposes that Reid is inconsistent in speaking of the object of self-love sometimes as one’s happiness and sometimes as including morethanpleasure.⁵⁹ Sidgwick findstheseremarksinconsistent becauseheassumes, without any warrant, that Reid uses ‘happiness’ in a hedonist sense. Reid’s view is (for all Sidgwick shows) quite clear and consistent. 
- Reid relies on his conception of superior principles in order to answer people who claim that ultimate ends are simply a matter of taste, and that reason has no role in the evaluation of ends. He considers an argument that begins from an admitted difference in taste—over the taste of lobsters and cheese.⁶⁵ Reid answers that it is wrong to say there is no room to apply rational judgment to the question about cheese and lobsters. On the contrary, rational judgment tells us that both tastes are equally good, and that there is nothing wrong if the cheese lover and the lobster lover follow their different tastes. In the case of the life of virtue and the life of pleasure, rational judgment is just as competent as it is the case of cheese and lobster. In this case it says that the two lives are not equally good; we can justly reproach the person who leads the life of pleasure. 
- Reid’s choice between cheese and lobster seems to be an example in which we simply have to register the comparative strength of our desires. If this were a complete account, our choices in such cases would be no different from the choices of agents without superior principles.
Reid points out that this conclusion is false. In cases where the choice is a matter of taste, a rational agent who has superior principles recognizes that this is so. 
- Hume’s account of the origin of prudent desires and actions appeals to the effect of abstraction and distance in causing me to think of a future event without its attendant circumstances.⁷³ Abstraction causes me to form a desire for a future good, and this desire causes me to follow the prudent course of action.
The transitions from one desire to another must be purely causal and psychological, not at all based on justifying reasons. If Hume is wrong about this, his appeal to a calm passion and to instrumental reasoning is not sufficient to explain the role of practical reason in prudence.
One might sometimes suppose that Reid regards the prudent outlook as the result of a purely psychological process.⁷⁴ Hume might suppose he could easily accept this, as a purely natural, psychological fact about the empirically observed tendency to pursue our overall good once we have formed the conception of it.
But Reid does not refer to a purely empirical tendency. He suggests, in agreement with Price, that it is essential to rational agents to desire their overall good, and that no special sense or feeling is needed to cause us to act on beliefs about our own good.⁷⁵ In Reid’s and Price’s view, it is irrational to fail to pursue one’s own happiness, whether or not we assume a calm passion of the sort Hume recognizes.
- Reid and Price over-state their objection to Hume’s view of prudence in suggesting that it is strictly self-contradictory for agents to know that something promotes their good and to recognize no reason for pursuing it. But they have good reason to maintain that it is not a mere psychological fact that agents form a desire to do what promotes their overall good.
They suggest that it would be irrational to the point of unintelligibility if agents did not recognize their own good as a justifying reason for an action, and if this justifying reason did not sometimes provide an exciting reason.⁷⁶
- In that case Reid is right, though he does not explain why he is right, to argue that recognition of the reality of our future states is all that is needed to justify concern for them, and that failure to see a reason to be concerned for our good as a whole would be a mark of deep irrationality. 
- If Reid is right on this point, Hume is wrong, because he has not mentioned all the functions of reason. The recognition that it is rational to pursue my own good is not the result of reasoning about causes and effects in general, or about means to ends in particular.
Though imprudent actions may rest on the same sort of causal reasoning that underlies prudent actions, it does not follow that they are as rational as prudent actions.
Reid, therefore, is not merely saying that we call prudent action rational; he is claiming that such action really is rational, insofar as it involves a correct exercise of practical reason that is absent from imprudent action. Hume does not answer this objection to his argument.
He cannot fairly assume that his opponents accept his account of the functions of reason, and so have to show that prudent action is more rational, on these terms, than imprudent action is. Reid rejects this assumption, since he rejects Hume’s account of the functions of reason.
- Reid denies that we are determined to action by the strongest motive (H 610a = R 882).⁸³ First he asks how we are to understand the comparative strength of motives. If a motive’s being stronger consists merely in its actual prevalence—in the fact that we act on it—the claim that we act on the strongest motive is trivially analytic. But two other conceptions of strength of motive make it non-trivial to claim that we act on the strongest motive:
    - The ‘animal test’ measures strength by the conscious effort required to resist a desire
    - The ‘rational test’ measures strength by considering ‘that which it is most our duty and our real happiness to follow’
- Either test of strength shows, in Reid’s view, that the strongest motive does not always prevail. For we sometimes act against the motive that is stronger by either test. If Reid’s two tests are exhaustive, he wins. Hume needs to show that there is some third type of strength or motivational force that is different from each of Reid’s two types, and explains action and motivation. 
- Reid’s distinction between two types of strength rests on Butler’s distinction between authority and power; ‘rational strength’ simply indicates greater authority. If Hume were correctinsupposingthatthereisnothingdistinctivelyrationalaboutprudence,thedistinction between power and authority would disappear. For prudence consists in being moved by the weight of reasons and not simply by the strength of one’s desires. If someone just happened to prefer his longer-term over his shorter-term satisfaction because of some irrational tendency to favour the more distant over the more immediate future, he might often choose what a prudent person would choose, but he would not thereby be a prudent person.⁸⁶ For the prudent person responds to the case that can be made for one or another course of action, regarding this case as something different from the current strength of non-rational desires in favour of the different courses of action.
In believing that two kinds of motivation differ in this way, we are not making any of the mistakes about reason that Hume identifies. We recognize a type of response that seems clearly rational; it is a different sort of response from the sort that Hume can recognize.
According to Hume, we understand prudence simply by recognizing the relevant calm passion. A calm passion, however, is not responsive to the weight of reasons; as Hume conceives a calm passion, it can only respond to the strength of desires. Since Hume allows us no capacity to respond to the weight of reasons, he does not recognize practical rationality.
But prudence seems to involve rationality, since it seems no less rational to fit our desire to the weight of reasons than it does to fit our belief to the weight of evidence.
Hume answer this objection by rejecting the theoretical parallel to practical reason; for he might deny that there is any such thing as fitting our belief to the weight of evidence, in contrast to simply following our stronger inclination. His analysis of belief in Book i of the Treatise suggests that the division between following the weight of evidence and following the stronger inclination is misconceived. But if Hume has to appeal to this radically sceptical side of his epistemology, Reid wins his main point. Hume does not want his moral philosophy to depend on his radical scepticism, and his case becomes less persuasive if it depends on the epistemological doctrines that are most difficult to accept.
He might try a more moderate reply to Reid by arguing that in the practical case, though not in the theoretical case, we are wrong to distinguish the weight of reasons from the strength of desire; though we seem to see a difference, there is none. If Hume says this, he accepts part of the Hobbesian strategy of reducing normative to psychological properties;
though we believe the purely psychological differs from the normative, all we are actually talking about are purely psychological properties involving strength of desire. But if Hume goes this far, his position is more nihilistic than he recognizes; he has to say that our deliberative practice rests on false beliefs and that it could not be expected to survive the discovery of the falsity of these beliefs.
Reid’s discussion of Hume, therefore, is not conclusive, because it is, from one point of view, superficial. Because he attacks Hume for disagreeing with common sense and ordinary usage, we might criticize him for failing to grasp the ways in which Hume intends to replace common assumptions and prejudices with a true account based on a sound psychology.
This criticism of Reid, however, would be unfair. By making clear the extent of Hume’s commitments to scepticism or to nihilism, he shows how extreme a position Hume has to take. Since this is a more extreme position than Hume acknowledges, Reid raises a fair question about whether we ought to accept all the claims that commit us to the implications of Hume’s position. 
- Reid agrees with Price in affirming the intuitive character of moral knowledge, the rejection of psychological hedonism, the irreducibility of conscience to self-love, and the rejection of utilitarianism. 
- In arguing that moral beliefs rest on intuitive first principles that are evident to common sense, Reid relies on his general view that we have no rational alternative to trusting common sense. He does not rely as heavily as Price does on a parallel between moral principles and geometrical principles (though he accepts the parallel). Instead, he takes moral knowledge to be analogous to ordinary perceptual knowledge, believing that the same sort of defence is appropriate in each case.
To this extent it would be misleading to call him a rationalist. Cudworth, Clarke, and Price argue that moral knowledge should be contrasted with ordinary perceptual knowledge of the physical world, and so should be treated as some sort of a priori knowledge of necessary truths, rather than the sort of knowledge we might acquire from a special sense; Reid sees no need to insist on this sharp contrast, and so he recognizes a moral sense.¹ In taking moral judgments to be expressions of a moral sense, Hutcheson and Hume intend these claims: (1) 
    - Moral ‘judgments’ are immediate reactions, not reached by reason-ing and inference from prior judgments and principles. Reid, following Price, agrees with Hutcheson’s first claim about moral judgments, that they are in some way immediate.³
    - They are sensory and emotional reactions, rather than strictly judgments based on recognition of evidence. Reid separates himself from both Hutcheson and Price in rejecting their common assumption that to speak of a moral sense is to commit oneself to anti-intellectualism and anti-realism. 
    - They are about the effect of external objects (actions, people, etc.) on us, not about the objects them-selves. He also follows Price in rejecting the inference from immediacy to anti-realism. 
These points embody Price’s understanding of Hutcheson’s position. He sees that Hutcheson reaches these conclusions by supposing these are all features of the senses.
According to Hutcheson, we are right to speak of a moral sense because our moral judgments share all these features with sensory reactions. Since Price broadly agrees with Hutcheson’s view of a sense, he rejects Hutcheson’s belief in a moral sense; he rejects the anti-intellectualist epistemology embodied in the second alleged feature of moral judgments, and the anti-realist metaphysics embodied in the third.
- Reid, however, is not simply claiming the right to use ‘moral sense’ as broadly as Butler does. He also believes that Price and Hutcheson are wrong to suppose that a more precise analogy with the senses commits us to anti-intellectualism and anti-realism.⁵In his view, both empiricists and rationalists lack ‘just notions of the offices of the external senses’, because they attribute too few intellectual functions to ordinary perception. Their conception of the externalsensesdeterminestheirconceptionofamoralsense;thatiswhytheempiricistsattrib-ute moral judgments to a moral sense, and that is why rationalists reject any moral sense. If we recognize an analogy between the moral sense and the external senses, we need not take the analogy to deny the objectivity of moral properties. Hutcheson’s use of the analogy with the senses expresses, according to Reid, a basic error about the senses in general.⁷ In calling the senses ‘powers by which we judge’, Reid means that they allow us to detect actual features of external objects, and that our judgments that external objects have these features are immediate and reliable judgments. Among judgments of the senses he includes the judgment that one sound is loud, another soft, and that synchronous sounds are discordant or concordant (H 590a). These are not purely sensory states, but include beliefs and judgments that inform us reliably about the objective features of external objects. If Price had accepted Reid’s conception of a sense, he would have had to qualify his opposition to the moral sense.
- Reid sees the same error in his opponents’ references to moral ‘sentiments’. He takes sentiments to include the operations of reason and judgment.⁸ This is a legitimate objection to Hume and Smith. In tracing moral distinctions to a moral sense or to moral sentiments, they offer a reductive anti-rationalist account, showing that these distinctions (i.e., our drawing these distinctions) between right and wrong depend on sense or emotion rather than on reason and judgment. But if they rely on a false account of a sense and a sentiment, they do not succeed in eliminating reason and judgment from moral distinctions.
- Belief in a moral sense is reasonable for Reid, who holds the opposite view to Hutcheson’s about the objectivity of moral qualities and about the relation of the moral sense to the feeling of approval. In attending to perceptual judgments, Reid also rejects Hutcheson’s view of the place of reason and feeling in moral judgments. Hutcheson identifies the moral sense with the feeling of approval, and supposes that the moral goodness we approve is a state that depends on the observer’s perception (in accordance with Locke’s account of secondary qualities, as Hutcheson interprets it). Reid, however, believes that the moral sense informs us about objective properties; its judgments are the appropriate basis for our feeling of approval, not the feeling itself (H 590ab). He develops the position that Burnet and Balguy maintain against Hutcheson.¹⁰
- If Reid rejects Hutcheson’s anti-realist conception of a sense, he should also reject either internalism (moral -> reason -> motive) or Hutcheson’s defence of it.
- His position on this question is not clear. He seems to accept some sort of internalism.¹² But it is not clear whether he means that it would be self-contradictory to ascribe to someone a moral judgment without the corresponding affection or emotion. Nor does he say whether the relevant connexion between judgment and affection is present in every sincere moral judgment.
He seems to mean, however, that the connexion between moral judgment and affection is not simply a product of early training or of one’s social environment. He seems to have a less contingent connexion in mind when he speaks of the ‘constitution of our nature’. He suggests that we have not only the capacity to form moral judgments, but also the capacity to make our emotional reactions conform to our judgments of worth; that is why our attitudes of admiration, esteem, and indignation, directed both to others and to ourselves, follow our moral judgments. 
- Reid’s claims rely on one necessary truth about emotions. If we had an emotion that was not guided by moral judgments of worth, that emotion would not be esteem or indignation;
for these specific emotions depend on the relevant judgments of worth. It is not the same sort of necessary truth, however, that we have such emotions as esteem and indignation. It does not seem self-contradictory to suppose an agent capable of moral judgment but lacking the capacity to form the corresponding emotions.
In reply to Hume, therefore, Reid does not seem to maintain the connexion between moral judgments and sentiments that constitutes Hume’s internalism.¹³ He maintains that it is essential to human agency that we have the capacity to form emotions that follow our moral judgments; if we lacked this capacity, our moral judgments would not have the role in human agency that they actually have. Since this is Reid’s position, he has no reason to accept Hume’s argument from internalism to anti-rationalism and anti-realism. He agrees that the role of the moral sense in human agency requires a connexion with sentiments, but he does not infer that the moral sense is a tendency to have these sentiments. He maintains that it is the capacity to form the relevant sorts of moral judgments. 
- Reid therefore believes that previous rationalists were wrong to deny that moral judgments belong to a moral sense. They were wrong because they had the wrong idea of a moral sense, and they had this wrong idea because they assumed too much Lockean empiricism.
Moral and perceptual knowledge are sharply distinct only if the empiricists are right about the character of perceptual knowledge. If empiricism leads to scepticism, we ought to reject the first moves that lead us along this sceptical path. Hence we ought to reject the empiricist account of perceptual knowledge. In Reid’s view, moral knowledge is not especially controversial. We have good reason to claim knowledge of objective moral facts and properties if we accept a non-sceptical account of perceptual knowledge.
Hutcheson and Hume rely on an empiricist account of perceptual knowledge, in order to defend a parallel account of moral knowledge. The rationalists, assuming that this account of perceptual knowledge is more or less right, insist that moral knowledge cannot be understood in the same way. Reid disagrees more fundamentally with the empiricists, and so need not deny that moral knowledge is similar in important ways to perceptual knowledge.
This criticism is especially effective against Hume, because Hume believes that his rationalist opponents have to make moral judgment mysterious. He argues that we cannot treat it as demonstrative knowledge, and we cannot understand how it could be ordinary perceptual knowledge of matters of fact in the object. Reid accepts Hume’s first point, but rejects his second. According to Reid, moral judgment is no more mysterious than ordinary perception. Since we must treat the external senses as involving judgments about features of the objects themselves, we have no reason to reject the moral sense simply because it also involves judgments about features of the external objects.
- Reid believes that Hume’s Treatise embodies the errors that are implicit in the whole empiricist position derived from Locke.¹⁴ In an exchange of letters with Reid, Hume sees that Reid takes him to have articulated the implications of an empiricist position.¹⁵ Reid agrees; and so he claims that a refutation of Hume is also a refutation of apparently more moderate positions that really lead to Hume’s conclusions.¹⁶ To refute Hume’s scepticism, then, we need to question the apparently plausible principles that constitute the apparently more moderate empiricist position of Locke. If we refute the empiricist principles, we have a firmer basis, according to Reid, for a true account of moral knowledge. 
- Like Price, Reid is a cognitivist and a realist. He also agrees with Price in restricting the definability of moral properties. He does not argue as elaborately as Price does by appeal to an open question argument; but he claims that some basic moral concepts (e.g. ‘duty’, ‘will’) cannot begivena‘logical’ definition(H 587a). Inobjecting toproposeddefinitionsof‘duty’ he says we can define it ‘only by synonymous words or phrases, or by its properties and  necessary concomitants’ (H 587a). He makes a similar claim about the definability of active power.
- It is easy to see why Reid rejects attempted definitions that simply provide concomitants, such as ‘duty is what is in itself laudable, though no man should praise it’.¹⁸ These attempts do not explain what makes duty laudable. He also objects to attempted definitions that provide only synonymous expressions (e.g., ‘duty is what we ought to do’, or ‘duty is what is fair and honest’). Logical definitions must be reductive. We give a reductive account if we define F as G, and we can understand what Gs are without understanding what Fs are.
Since he imposes this condition only on logical definitions, Reid’s rejection of definitions for moral properties leaves room for definitions that do not meet his strict conditions.¹
- The difference between Reid’s conception of synonymy and a more familiar conception becomes clearer once we notice that some definitions stating synonymies—as we would normally suppose—seem to meet his conditions for a reductive definition. We could know what a fox is and what a female is without knowing what a vixen is, and there seems to be nothing more to being a vixen than being a female fox. The same sort of test would perhaps allow more ambitious claims about identity of properties to count as definitions;
‘temperature is mean kinetic energy’ seems to count. At least, since Reid does not appeal to Price’s open question argument, he seems to raise no objection in principle to such an account of a property.
In Reid’s view the fact that we cannot give a ‘logical’ definition of something is no reason for denying the existence of the definiendum.²⁰ He begins his discussion of active power by arguing that we cannot give a logical definition, but he objects to Hume’s inference that we therefore have no idea of power. Hume objects that ‘the terms efficacy, agency, power, force, energy, are all nearly synonymous; and therefore it is an absurdity to employ any of them in defining the rest’ (H 520b).²¹ Reid answers that there is nothing absurd about this.²² We should not be surprised by the failure of logical definition if the definiendum is simple. This claim about simplicity is not entirely justified. In admitting that our ‘definitions’ are synonymies and not logical definitions, we do not imply that the definiendum is simple; we may mean that the different elements we introduce in our definition cannot be understood without reference to one another. If the definiendum has an organic structure, the whole cannot be understood without reference to the parts, nor the parts without reference to the whole. Reid, therefore, does not show that the failure of logical, reductive definitions indicates the simplicity of the definiendum. Simplicity need not be the only explanation of irreducibility.
- Reid’s concentration on simplicity affects his conclusions about the definability of moral properties. Since he takes simplicity to be the only ground of logical indefinability, he argues from the indefinability of moral concepts and properties to their simplicity; they have no simpler elements that might provide the basis for a logical definition. It would be more plausible to appeal to irreducibility. If different moral concepts can be defined by reference to one another, but cannot be defined reductively through non-moral concepts, they may be complex but irreducible. Perhaps ‘ought’, ‘right’, ‘obligation’, and ‘reason’ are to be defined by reference to one another, and none of them can be defined without reference to at least one of the others. This explanation of the irreducibility of moral concepts is better than the explanation that appeals to simplicity.
- If we detach irreducibility from simplicity, we can also detach Price’s and Reid’s arguments against logical definitions of moral concepts from their specific epistemological views about simplicity and immediacy. We have good reason to do this if we are doubtful about these epistemological views. The arguments about irreducibility do not depend on intuitionism about moral knowledge. 
- In saying that the only definitions we can give of duty are mere synonymies, Reid seems to mean that we can give no reductive definition of the kind that we can give (for different reasons) for ‘vixen’ and for ‘temperature’. His view that no such reductive account is possible is defensible, but Reid is not clear about the sort of defence that it might need. The fact that a particular account (for instance a utilitarian account) initially seems unintuitive does not show that it is unsuccessful; many reductive accounts seem unintuitive until we understand the theory that underlies them. We cannot, then, refute reductive definitions just by looking at them without reference to the relevant theory. Reid examines and rejects reductive arguments that would allow us to explain the crucial moral concepts by reference to self-interest, or to the reactions of a particular kind of agent, or to maximization of utility.
These arguments need to be considered if we are to evaluate his claims about the sense in which moral properties are indefinable.
- Reid claims not only that moral properties are indefinable, but also that basic moral truths are self-evident, not grounded on any further truths. He believes this for foundationalist reasons. In his view all knowledge must have foundations ‘on which the whole fabric of the science leans’ (H 637a), and which have no further foundation. When a question arises about them, we must appeal not to some further justifying argument, but to common sense (H 637a; cf. 590b–591a).²³ The defence of the analogy between moral knowledge and ordinary perceptual knowledge also makes it reasonable, in Reid’s view, to treat both perceptual judgments and moral judgments as foundations. Even if moral beliefs must have some foundation, the foundation need not be moral beliefs. If the sort of reduction that Reid rejects for moral concepts and properties were possible, a foundationalist might argue that the self-evident foundation for moral beliefs consists in non-moral beliefs. Reid’s version of foundationalism rests partly on his argument against reduction.
- He believes we ought not to seek any proof of a first principle, since our search may raise unnecessary doubts that would not otherwise have arisen.
Reid’s objection to attempts to defend first principles is not convincing. I might find that my belief in p is more confident than my belief in any principle that is used in an argument for p, and so I might still regard it as apparently self-evident. But it is always fair to ask whether I am justified in retaining my confidence in p; though I find that I cannot give up my belief in p, how do I remove any question about whether my confidence does not simply reflect my irrational stubbornness? I might find this question troublesome if p appears to conflict with q and r, which seem quite plausible to me, though less plausible than p. 
- Our doubts about our attitude to p would be removed or reduced if we could show that in fact q and r support p. We have better grounds for our confidence that p is more certain than our other beliefs if we find that our other beliefs rely on the truth of p. This form of argument defends p by appeal to beliefs that appear less certain than p. Such a defence should not shake our belief in p.
This argument raises doubts about foundationalism in general. For once we ask whether our impressions of greater certainty are reliable in a particular case, we may reasonably consider the relation of a fundamental belief to other beliefs. Once we do that, we imply that an appeal to coherence confers some degree of justification.²⁵ Reid is right to claim that his foundationalism excludes the sort of defence of basic principles that we have described.
But his objection that such a defence raises new doubts is unfounded; instead of rejecting the possibility of such a defence, he should have re-examined his foundationalism. 
- Reid defends his cognitivist and realist account of moral judgments in his Chapter 7, ‘That moral approbation implies a real judgment’, where he discusses Hume’s anti-realist and anti-rationalist position.²⁶ He starts from his disagreement with Hume about the character of a moral judgment. According to Reid, it is a real judgment about the qualities of external objects, and it provides the basis for the feeling of approval to which Hume wants to reduce it. According to Reid, Hume’s attempted reduction of judgment to feeling is the product of Hume’s general epistemological position.²⁷ Reid argues that the common belief that reason is the source of moral judgments is correct, and that Hume is wrong to reject it.
- The two Humean theses:
    - Reason is not the source of motivation. We can accept Hume’s first thesis without the second, if we reject internalism about moral judgment and motivation; for Hume relies on internalism in his arguments to show that moral distinctions are not  derived from reason. As we have seen, Reid seems—though his position is not clear—to reject internalism.²⁸ But he does not draw attention to this issue. 
    - Moral ‘judgments’ are really feelings in the observer. Hume’s second thesis is particularly important for Reid’s purposes; for, if we accept it, we lose one reason for believing that rational judgments can move us to action. Reid, therefore, argues directly against Hume’s second thesis, independently of the first. 
- He argues against Hume and Hutcheson that we do not speak of moral judgments as though we identified them with feelings of approbation. He remarks that moral judgments appear to claim truth and falsehood and to be open to contradiction, in a way that separates them from feelings (H 673ab). This sort of argument is useful, though inconclusive. For it forces sentimentalists to admit that they do not give an account of our ordinary conception of moral judgment; they really argue that this conception is mistaken and should be replaced.
Once we see that sentimentalists reject the ordinary conception, we can focus on the main question, about where they think the ordinary conception is mistaken. 
- Reid relies on some of his epistemology, and especially on some of his claims about the moral sense, in order to shift the burden of proof that Hume tries to place on his opponents. He takes Hume’s questions about how we can reach ‘ought’ from ‘is’ to express an illegitimate demand for an explanation of ‘ought’ and ‘ought not’. In Reid’s view (H 675b–676a), these cannot be explained by a reductive, ‘logical’ definition, but they can be explained by a ‘synonymous’ definition of ‘ought’. Unless Hume can show that the absence of a reductive definition shows that ‘ought’ is unintelligible, his objection has no force. 
- Hume asks why we should infer an ‘ought’ judgment from ‘is’ judgments—why, for instance, we should infer from the fact that A killed B without provocation the con-clusion that A acted wrongly. Reid does not say how exactly he understands Hume’s question. But we might reasonably take Hume to observe that it does not seem ana-lytic that unprovoked homicide is wrong, and then to ask what makes it wrong. Reid seems to understand Hume to ask this question. He answers that the question is ille-gitimate. Basic moral judgments (e.g., ‘harming an innocent person is wrong’) are not to be derived from anything more basic, since they are themselves first principles. Since we must eventually come to first principles, we have no reason to reject an appeal to judgments that rest on no further judgments. Hume has not shown why moral judg-ments should not play this role. If we are foundationalists, our foundation need not be non-moral. 
- Reid argues against Hume’s criticism of the view that moral rightness or wrongness is a quality of the object. If we consider ingratitude, we will never, according to Hume, find its demerit or blame if we just examine the external circumstances themselves.³⁰ Reid disagrees on this point. But he agrees with Hume that the wrongness of an action produces a sentiment, provided that a sentiment is taken to include a judgment as well as a feeling. Reid ought not to agree that the property making the action wrong is its tendency to produce a certain judgment in the observer. Such an account of the wrong-making property conflicts with Reid’s account of the observer’s judgment; for, in his view, the observer’s judgment includes the belief that the action itself has some moral property independent of this judgment. And so, even if the wrongness of an action tends to produce a certain effect in an observer, Reid should insist that the wrongness itself consists in the property of the object, not in the tendency to provoke the observer’s judgment. He implicitly insists on this point when he speaks of the judgment being true (H 676b). If ingratitude provokes a true judgment of (say) condemnation in the observer, it must have whatever property warrants condemnation; this property, not the tendency to provoke condemnation, is the wrongness of the ingratitude. Hume believes that this conception of moral judgment is untenable, because no intelligible account can be given of the property that (on the view he rejects) we attribute to the object.
According to Hume, we can know all the relevant matters of fact about the object before we raise a moral question about it:³¹ Reid argues that if Hume were right on this point, there would be no further room for a judge’s understanding to operate after the evidence has been given. As Reid insists, the judge has a further fact to discover—‘whether the plaintiff has a just plea or not’ (H 677a).
Reid could have strengthened this point by observing that in other cases also, we have to use our judgment to draw a conclusion from available evidence about the nature of a situation. We ask, for instance, whether Tom’s doing what he did in Dick’s presence constituted making a promise to Dick, and whether what Dick did in Harry’s presence constituted an insult or a threat to Harry. In such cases, we are not consulting our own reactions; we are asking whether one sort of fact constitutes another sort.³ The point of Reid’s objection, therefore, is explained by Anscombe in ‘Facts’. Hume assumes that in the moral case our conclusion or verdict cannot introduce a further fact about the object besides the ones he has mentioned. But he does not justify this assumption. He would have justified it if he had shown that any further fact must be specifiable through reductive definition in non-moral terms; but Reid casts reasonable doubt on whether Hume has shown this.
- To showthat Humehasno soundbasisforhisclaim that thewrongnessofan action cannot be a further fact about it besides the non-moral facts, Reid considers Hume’s argument for restricting the range of facts about the object. Hume suggests a parallel between moral goodness and beauty. He argues that ‘Euclid has fully explained all the qualities of the circle;
but has not in any proposition said a word of its beauty’ (IPM, App. 1.14); he infers that the moral goodness or badness, like beauty, cannot be a quality of external objects. Reid answers that Euclid concerns himself only with the geometrical properties of the circle, and does not attempt to describe all its properties (H 677ab). Hume’s reasons for denying that wrongness is a property of an object show at most that it is not a non-moral property of an object; but Reid correctly challenges Hume’s assumption that moral properties, if there are any, are reducible to non-moral properties.
- Finally, Reid considers Hume’s argument from ultimate ends. Hume argues that since ends cannot be infinitely regressive, some ends rest on no further reasoning, and therefore rest on feeling rather than reason. Reid points out (H 678ab) that this argument moves illegitimately, as Hutcheson does, from foundationalism about ends to sentimentalism about our grasp of ends.³³ If any argument can be made for sentimentalism from the fact that not all ends can be justified by reference to higher ends, it must be a more complicated argument than the one offered by Hutcheson and Hume.
Reid’s criticisms of Hume depend partly, but not wholly, on his foundationalism and on his specific views about the nature of the moral sense and the indefinability of moral properties.
He sometimes claims that Hume asks for inappropriate explanations through failure to see that some moral judgments are fundamental. But not all of Reid’s case against Hume depends onquestionableepistemologicalassumptions.HeargueseffectivelythatHumeneglectssome reasonable arguments that might be offered for the factual and objective character of moral judgments. On some points, indeed, it may be easier to answer Hume if we abandon Reid’s foundationalism for a more holist position. His main objections challenge Hume’s assumption that a satisfactory account of moral properties would have to be reductive. Once weseethat Reid’srejection oflogical definitionsleavesuswith moreroom than herecognizes to explain the character of moral properties, we should also find it easier to answer Hume. 
- Many aspects of people might cause a favourable feeling towards them, but only some favourable feelings on certain specific grounds belong to moral judgments about their goodness or badness.
Reid mentions the connexion between moral judgment and voluntariness. Not only must a morally good action be voluntary (H 589a), but it must also result from the right kind of voluntary process.³⁴ If we accept these constraints on moral approval, we cannot also, according to Reid, accept Hume’s account of moral approval. 
- If we were to reply, in partial defence of Hume, that moral approval is the feeling provoked by useful or agreeable qualities in the circumstances where we believe they are voluntary, we would be abandoning the main point (in Reid’s view) of Hume’s account of moral judgment. For this belief about the voluntariness of actions and qualities would have to be a constituent of moral approval, and it would limit the conditions in which moral approval is justified. In that case our moral judgment would be a belief about an objective fact providing a basis for the feeling of approval.
- Reid claims that the demand for voluntariness is basic; we do not take voluntariness to be a reliable indicator of something that we value for some other reason. We are not concerned with voluntary actions and qualities simply because we think they are the most likely to be stable, and therefore the best basis for predicting that the agent will keep the useful or agreeable traits in question. Hume’s attempt to reduce moral approval to approval of the agreeable or useful omits an essential element in moral approval and moral sentiment. 
- Once he has explained his view about the object of our moral approval, Reid considers a central puzzle in Hume’s account of justice. In Hume’s view, ‘no action can be virtuous or morally good, unless there be in human nature some motive to produce it, distinct from its morality’ (H 648a, 667b). Hume argues that the justice does not consist in the action itself, since we regard actions as just only insofar as they are the sign of a just character. But the agent’s reason for acting justly cannot simply be regard for a just character; for we do not know what a just character is unless we understand what a just action is. Hume seems to believe, then, that unless there is some further motive for doing one action rather than another besides the desire to act justly, we have not explained acting justly.⁴¹ Reid rejects Hume’s contention that we cannot take any moral attitude to actions apart from the motives of the agents. If an action relieves the sufferings of a person in distress, then we rightly approve of it. As Reid says, we think it ‘ought to be done by those who have the power and opportunity, and the capacity of perceiving their obligation to do it’ (H 649a).
We can think this about the action even if we think the agent acted from bad motives. Indeed, if we did not approve of actions apart from our views about the motive, we would deprive ourselves of an important part of the explanation of our approval of motives. For part of our basis for approval of motives is our approval of the actions that they tend to cause. If our approval of the actions in turn depended on our approval of the motives, we would be caught in a vicious circle. Reid seeks to remove the appearance of circularity by distinguishing formal from material goodness (H 649b–650a). Hume has given no reason for rejecting that distinction.
- Our explanation would go in a vicious circle if we could say only that the just person is the one who does just actions and that just actions are the sort of actions that a just person would do. One or the other of the just action and the just person must be independently specified if we are to understand either just actions or just agents. For similar reasons just people must be able to describe their just actions as more than simply ‘what a just person would do’; for we want to explain why just people choose these actions rather than some others, and we must cite something about the actions themselves. Just people are not indifferent to the properties of just actions; nor do they choose just actions simply as means to the exercise of just character.⁴²
- We might suggest, therefore, that to be a just person is to be concerned about equal distribution because it is just, and not because of some further benefit that we care about.
We may then ask why we should attach moral importance to equal distribution. On this sort of question Reid tends to appeal to intuition when we might reasonably seek some further explanation. But the further explanation need not introduce a non-moral motive for caring about equal distribution. 
- In thisasin othercases, wemight initially supposethat Reid’sanswerto Humeissuperficial because it rests on common-sense claims that Hume might appear to have undermined. But the more radical Humean arguments that would undermine the common-sense claims are not convincing enough to justify radical Humean conclusions. Reid’s criticisms mark weak points in Hume’s position. 
- Reid attacks Hume’s account of the origins of justice in self-interest and his utilitarian account of rules of justice. He argues that:
    - our belief that some things are just and that just action is obligatory does not depend on the existence of rules or conventions that are in everyone’s selfish interest. For it is difficult to give a convincing utilitarian account of justice (replying to Reid’s second point) unless we can tie principles of justice to some appropriate set of rules and conventions (replying to Reid’s first point). Hume points out that while the utilitarian benefits of benevolence are easily seen (as long as we are not very careful to distinguish immediate from long-term utility), we cannot easily give a parallel account of justice.⁴⁴ In order to respond to Butler’s objections, he has to appeal to the effects of a system of rules. 
- our belief about what is just and about why just actions are obligatory does not depend on any belief about utility.
When Hume claims that justice is an artificial virtue, he has both these points in mind.
- According to Reid, the intuitive status that utilitarians claim for the principle of utility really belongs to a number of moral principles.⁵⁰ If our moral convictions cannot all be explained by the utilitarian principle, but can be explained by other principles that are at least as intuitively clear as the utilitarian principle, a non-utilitarian conviction is not necessarily irrational.
- We might welcome some argument that takes us beyond these competing appeals to intuition. If we could find some reason for believing that a utilitarian or a non-utilitarian reconstruction of ordinary beliefs has some claim to be a better reconstruction, we would have some more systematic reason for preferring it. Reid’s basic epistemological outlook opposes the search for a more general account of basic moral principles. But since the examination of issues in moral theory seems to justify a search for some such general account, perhaps the epistemological outlook that causes Reid to stop the argument where he does should be re-examined. The fact that we would like to go further does not imply that an attempt to go further is bound to succeed. If it fails, Reid’s position may be best;
perhaps we have failed to do something that cannot be done. But if we see the questions that he leaves unanswered, we have some reason to take some of Kant’s questions seriously. 
- Reid differs from Price; for he gives a much better account of the conception of happiness that supports the efforts of Greek moralists to reconcile morality and self-interest. He exploits this conception of happiness to argue for the systematic agreement of self-love with morality, in defence of Butler against Price. But he does not accept eudaemonism. He argues, as Butler does, that, despite the coincidence of the two principles, morality is distinct from and superior to self-love.⁵¹ If Reid is right, a plausible conception of happiness does not weaken the case for the independence of conscience from self-love.
Reid’s generally favourable attitude to Greek eudaemonism rests on his account of the characteristic Greek conception of happiness. He sees that the Stoics’ conception of happiness as our good on the whole, and their arguments about the role of practical reason in reducing irrational dependence on external goods, underlie their defence of the virtues of character.
He attributes the same view, free of Stoic exaggerations, to Socrates and Plato (H 583a). This eudaemonist argument ‘leads directly to the virtues of prudence, temperance, and courage’
- His attitude to the other-regarding virtues is more complex. He recognizes that a eudaemonist argument offers some defence of them.⁵² In fact, he seems to combine two arguments:
    - Since our good consists in satisfying our affections, and since our affections include other-directed affections, satisfaction of other-directed affections is part of our good. These two arguments rest on different conceptions of a person’s good. The first relies on a conative conception, finding one’s good in the satisfaction of desire. 
    - Since we are ‘social creatures’ and our ‘happiness or misery’ is connected with the circumstances of others, our good consists in fulfilling our nature, and sharing the good of others is part of our nature; hence sharing the good of others is also part of our good. The second relies on a naturalist conception, finding one’s good in the fulfilment of one’s nature. Reid’s account of happiness supports the second argument. It is easy to run the two arguments together, if one recognizes that one’s natural affections are parts of one’s nature. But they are still distinct arguments, since one can satisfy one’s natural affections without fulfilling one’s nature. If, for instance, our natural affection for our own good or the good of others is not strong enough to direct us to the appropriate pursuit of its object, we might satisfy it without doing enough for our own good or the good of others, and so without fulfilling our nature. This is one of Butler’s reasons for distinguishing the rational principles of self-love, benevolence, and conscience from our natural affections. 
- If the naturalist argument is primary, Reid should appeal to our nature as social creatures.
According to this argument, the fulfilment of our nature requires the fulfilment of our capacity to live in societies that involve concern for the good of others for their own sakes. If this is what Reid has in mind, he appeals to the sort of argument that Aristotle and Aquinas offer in defence of friendship. 
- It is not clear, however, whether he means to endorse such arguments for the social virtues. If he endorses them, he recognizes eudaemonist arguments for the motives and intentions characteristic of the virtuous agent; for he recognizes that the right intention is necessary if we are to judge that the agent is good, and not simply that the action was good (H 649a).⁵⁴ But he seems to hesitate on this aspect of eudaemonism. After saying that eudaemonism argues for ‘the practice of every virtue’, he also agrees that it leads to the virtues themselves (H 638a). But he seems to qualify this agreement, since he adds that the eudaemonist’s motive is not the motive of the virtuous person.⁵⁵ This contrast between loving virtue for its own sake and loving it for the sake of happiness suggests that Reid does not firmly accept the traditional eudaemonist argument that makes virtue a non-instrumental good that is part of happiness.
- Though Reid agrees that a reasonable conception of happiness leads us indirectly to the practice of the social virtues, he nonetheless insists that the principle of self-love is defective ‘if it be supposed, as it is by some philosophers, to be the only regulating principle of human conduct’ (H 584b).⁵⁶ What conception of self-love underlies these claims about its defects?
We might suppose Reid simply argues against the view that all our affections are reducible to forms of self-love. Butler ascribes this position to Hobbes, and rejects it. But Reid also seems to deny that self-love is (to use Butler’s terms) the supreme practical principle. He argues that ‘disinterested regard to duty’ is an independent principle not subordinate to self-love (H 584b). Eudaemonism, therefore, is wrong to make self-love superior to every other principle, and thereby to distort the role of conscience. 
-Reid offers three arguments against the supremacy of self-love: 
    - The eudaemonist reasoning that justifies the moral virtues is too complicated for everyone to follow, and will not necessarily move everyone as sharply as a sense of duty moves us. The first argument maintains that if we all treated moral obligation as dependent on our conception of happiness, many of us would not be appropriately moved by moral obligation. Reid does not dispute the soundness of the eudaemonist argument to show that our overall good requires the moral virtues; he simply argues that it is hazardous to make everyone’s commitment to morality depend on acceptance of an argument that most people may not grasp. It is morally desirable, therefore, to find non-eudaemonist grounds that give us sufficient reason to be moral. This practical argument does not show that there are grounds independent of happiness for moral obligation; it simply shows that we ought to look for them, and that if we find them, we ought to welcome them. But we may concede to Reid that his arguments about the moral sense show that we have such grounds. Still, agreement on this point does not settle the issue about subordination; for it does not settle how far we have reason to stick to moral obligations when they conflict with other aspects of our good. If we agree that we have some rational grounds independent of our overall good, we may still ask how these grounds are to be compared with our grounds for pursuing other goods. To answer this question, we may still, for all Reid has shown, need to appeal to happiness. 
    - Eudaemonism provides the wrong motive for cultivating the virtues.⁵⁸ Our demand for the appropriate motive in the virtuous person conflicts with the supremacy of self-love. The second argument is more directly relevant to the question about subordination. Even if eudaemonists recognize virtue as a primary element of one’s good, they must (in Reid’s view) take a ‘mercenary’ attitude to virtue. What is this mercenary attitude that prevents our valuing virtue at its proper worth? We might understand it in two ways (Reid’s different remarks suggest that he has each of these views in mind in different places, and that he probably does not distinguish them): 
        - It is the attitude that values virtue purely instrumentally. If Reid refers to the first attitude, he is right to say that it is incompatible with the ordinary understanding of a virtuous person. But a eudaemonist need not accept it. For many eudaemonists argue that virtuous action is worth choosing for its own sake, and is therefore a part of happiness; we can value virtue for its own sake and still be eudaemonists.
        - It is the attitude that values virtue because of its contribution to happiness. If Reid has the second attitude in mind, he is right to say that eudaemonists are committed to it. But it does not require a purely instrumental approach to the virtues. Reid might believe that our normal attitude to virtue requires a strongly disinterested concern that conflicts with eudaemonism. But he does not justify this belief.
    - The eudaemonist attitude is self-defeating; for if we do not take happiness as our only ultimate end, we will in fact achieve more happiness than if we are eudaemonists.⁵⁹ The third argument seeks to present a paradox of eudaemonism parallel to the paradox of hedonism. But it suffers from the obscurity that we have found in the second argument. Reid might mean: 
        - We will achieve more happiness if we value virtue for its own sake than if we value it purely instrumentally. The first claim is plausible, but does not conflict with eudaemonism. Eudaemonism does not require us to claim that happiness is the only thing worth choosing for its own sake. In fact, some eudaemonists argue that happiness is the ultimate end because it is composed of ends that are worth choosing for their own sakes. Hence we introduce no conflict in our beliefs if we believe both that something other than happiness is worth choosing for its own sake and that happiness is the only ultimate end. Reid would raise a genuine difficulty for eudaemonists if the belief that maximizes happiness is the belief that some particular non-ultimate end would still be preferable to anything else if something else promoted my happiness better. But he has not shown that someone maximizes happiness by holding this belief.
        - We will achieve more happiness if we have a strongly disinterested concern for virtue than we will achieve if our concern is related to our happiness.  The second claim conflicts with eudaemonism, but is it plausible?
- Reid’s third objection, then, rests on the sort of misunderstanding that also underlies his second objection. He seems to be wrong about the implications of the eudaemonist claim that happiness is the ultimate end. He seems to suppose that this claim implies a purely instrumental status for other goods; but the eudaemonist has no reason to agree with him. 
- Reid’s criticisms of eudaemonism assume, therefore, that a eudaemonist treats virtues as purely instrumental to happiness in some objectionable sense. He doubts whether a eudaemonist argument, treating self-love as the supreme principle, can justify the virtues, because he doubts whether it can justify our valuing the virtues for their own sakes, as a virtuous person values them. He takes this criticism to apply even to ‘the best moralists among the ancients’, including the Stoics.⁶⁰ But this objection to Stoicism is puzzling, given his other remarks.
Since Reid rejects the supremacy of self-love, he recognizes a distinct superior principle of duty.⁶¹ In his view, the irreducibility of duty is recognized by ordinary people and philosophers of all times and nearly all schools. Reid cites the Greek concept of the kalon, rendered in Latin by ‘honestum’. He believes, as Price does, that this concept expresses the right and the honourable, and marks the requirements of duty as opposed to interest.⁶² The morally virtuous person, according to Reid, recognizes that conscience and the sense of duty constitute an independent and sufficient rational principle. Reid takes the Stoics to acknowledge that the moral motive has this status; they clarify the devotion to duty and the moral motive that Reid takes to be characteristic of the morally good person.⁶³ This judgment on the Stoics seems to conflict with Reid’s view that they are eudaemonists.
He does not say how this apparent conflict is to be resolved. Indeed, in the contexts where he emphasizes the devotion of the Stoics to the honestum, he does not mention that they are eudaemonists. His objections to eudaemonism cast doubt on at least some of his views about the Stoics; for either his claims about the Stoics, or the Stoics’ own claims, seem to be inconsistent, and Reid does not try to remove the appearance of inconsistency. If the Stoics are eudaemonists, do they not take the mercenary attitude to virtue that is inconsistent with their devotion to the honestum? But if their position is consistent, Reid’s description of their position casts doubt on his criticism of eudaemonism. 
- This doubt affects Reid’s argument as a whole. He introduces the Stoic conception of the honestum in support of Butler’s belief in the distinctness and independence of conscience from self-love. But the Stoics do not seem to support Butler, since they do not separate the honestum from happiness. They recognize that the belief that an action is morally right is different from the belief that it contributes to my happiness. They also agree that belief in moral rightness provides a motive that is distinct from the desire for my happiness. But they do not infer that moral rightness gives me a justifying reason that is independent of any contribution to happiness.
Reid perhaps overlooks this distinction between the character of the moral motive and the justifying reason it provides. He goes too far in claiming that the Stoic sage was someone ‘in whom a regard to the honestum swallowed up every other principle of action’ (H 589a).
The claim that the moral motive ‘swallows up’ other principles of action is obscure on the crucial point. The Stoics believe that no other principle of action conflicts with the moral motive in the sage. But they do not believe that nothing else matters to sages besides the moral motive; sages also insist that action on the moral motive is the only element in their happiness, and the crucial element in the way of life that they aim at.⁶⁴ Reid might answer that this division between the moral motive and the eudaemonic justifying reason does not make the Stoic position consistent. For he might believe that acceptance of a eudaemonic justifying reason implies a mercenary attitude to virtue, and therebyexcludestherightattitudetomoralobligation.Thisanswerdependsonouraccepting Reid’s claim—implicit in some of his arguments—that the moral motive is not only distinct from the desire for happiness, but also requires indifference to happiness. But Reid has no good defence of this claim. Hence his case against the supremacy of self-love is not cogent. 
- Reid rejects eudaemonism, and believes that conscience constitutes a rational principle distinct from self-love. He therefore faces Butler’s question about which principle is superior, and why. He rejects the opinion that he attributes to some mediaeval mystics, that we should pay no attention to our happiness in this life or the afterlife. This is also the view of the Quietists whom Butler opposes as ‘enthusiasts’.⁶⁵ Reid takes his objections to the ‘mercenary’ aspects of eudaemonism to apply to the position accepted by Aquinas. The opposing view he rejects does not say simply that conscience is superior to self-love, but that we should renounce self-love altogether.
Reid agrees with Butler’s view that conscience is supreme.⁶⁶ He also agrees with Butler’s belief in the harmony of self-love and conscience. In his view, the opposition between conscience and self-love is ‘merely imaginary’, because following our conscience is in fact always for our good. 
- The reconciliation of conscience with self-love rests partly on the eudaemonist arguments that Reid has endorsed, even though he has rejected them as a reason for subordinating conscience to self-love. In the present context he especially emphasizes the theological reasons for believing in the harmony of the two principles. Those who believe in God and believe that God rewards virtue with eternal happiness need not consider their own happiness, as long as they follow their conscience in the questions that concern conscience.
Reid does not believe, however, that our only assurance of the harmony of duty and interestistheological.Hedescribessomeonewhorejectstheharmonyofthetwoprinciples.⁶⁷ In agreeing with Shaftesbury’s judgment on this case, Reid apparently disagrees with Butler, who rejects Shaftesbury’s claim that the case is without remedy.⁶⁸ The disagreement with Butler is, at first sight, surprising. For Butler criticizes Shaftesbury for neglecting the difference between strength and authority. He answers that, once we recognize the rational supremacy of conscience, we have sufficient reason to follow conscience, even if our inclinations or sentiments conflict and our benevolent sentiments are no stronger than our selfish ones. Reid should accept this criticism of Shaftesbury, since he agrees with Butler in insisting on the difference between strength and authority—as he puts it, between animal strength and rational strength.
Still, as Reid sees, Butler’s answer to Shaftesbury does not eliminate every possibility of a conflict between conscience and self-love. Reid is considering a different point from the one that Butler considers in answering Shaftesbury. He considers self-love not simply as an inclination or particular passion, but as ‘a leading principle’ of one’s nature. Reid recognizes that Butler’s naturalism is difficult to defend without the harmony of self-love and conscience.⁶⁹Denial oftheirharmony castsdoubt on theclaim that human natureconstitutes a system, and that, as both Reid and Butler insist, action on each of these principles is natural.
If Reid is to show that action on conscience is natural, he needs to rely on the eudaemonist arguments he has given for accepting the content of morality, even though he denies that they capture the moral motive. These are the arguments that a sceptic about the harmony of virtue and happiness has failed to grasp. Reid believes that the sceptic makes a mistake about virtue and happiness that is distinct from the mistake of being an atheist. Reid’s position, then, depends on the cogency of these eudaemonist arguments.
In considering the consequences of denying the harmony of duty and interest, Reid faces Sidgwick’s dualism of practical reason. Sidgwick believes in a dualism because he thinks that both self-love and conscience claim to be supreme; each claims that it is ultimately reasonable to follow it rather than any other principle. That is why we face a ‘fundamental contradiction’ (Sidgwick, ME 508) in practical reason, not simply an awkward practical conflict on possible particular occasions. If Sidgwick is right about what each principle says, no assurance of their practical harmony removes the fundamental difficulty raised by their contradictory claims about supremacy. 
- Reid, like Butler, rejects Sidgwick’s dualism; he does not believe that the two principles threaten the contradiction that Sidgwick describes. He asserts that conscience claims supremacy, but he does not assert that self-love claims it. He seems to follow Butler in treating self-love as a superior principle, but conscience as supreme.
If this is his view, should he infer that those who reject the harmony of the two principles face a miserable dilemma? He assumes that they must choose between (as it will appear to them) being a fool and being a knave. But he seems to exaggerate their difficulties. If we accept both principles as superior, we will presumably follow each of them on many occasions—we will neither be purely mercenary nor purely self-denying. We will violate either principle only on those occasions where the demand of the other seems to be especially urgent. We need not think of ourselves as knaves (on the occasions where we decide that the cost to self-love is too great for us to follow conscience) or fools (on the occasions when we sacrifice self-love for the sake of conscience). While Reid is justified in asserting the importance of belief in the harmony of duty and interest, he seems to exaggerate the bad effects of not recognizing their harmony. 
- If Reid affirms, with Butler, the supremacy of conscience, how does he justify himself?
He claims that we can see how conscience is a rational principle, and therefore a superior principle; but why is it supreme? Reid’s appeal to self-evidence is too hasty.⁷⁰ One ground for judging that we ought to do x is the fact that x is our duty.⁷¹ But, contrary to Reid, this is not the ground that decides whether conscience is superior to self-love. Even if conscience claims that there are moral grounds for preferring morality, it does not follow that moral grounds are to be preferred over purely prudential grounds. The moral ought-judgment needs to be supported by claims about overall reasonableness that go beyond the moral judgment. Reid’s argument to show that the superiority of conscience is self-evident is, therefore, dubious. If he appeals to a further self-evident principle that it is reasonable overall to follow conscience against self-love, he relies on intuition to settle a question that seems open to argument, and therefore does not seem to have a self-evident answer. 
- Can Reid show something more about the character of the moral point of view that would prove that conscience is supreme? One might ask why acceptance of the supremacy of conscience is natural. Something about the content of conscience should show us that in following it we express the systematic character of the different impulses and principles that constitute the nature of rational agents.
Reid suggests a possible partial answer to this naturalist demand. The first principles of morals include a principle enjoining reciprocity—that we should act towards others as we would judge it right for them in the same circumstances to act towards us (H 639a).⁷² He justifies this principle by arguing that we recognize its force whenever we are the victims of an offence.⁷³ Reid suggests that we cannot rationally avoid the impartial application of moral principles. We are ready to apply them to others, and we have no rational basis, if we are honest with ourselves, for refusing to apply them to ourselves as well.
- In demanding what we think is owed to us, we do not simply assert that we want something; for we do not resent the refusal to give us what we want unless we believe we deserve or are entitled to it. In believing this about ourselves, we apply a principle that rests on authority, since we appeal to reasons, and not simply to the strength of our desires.
Hence the application of these authoritative principles to ourselves commits us to accepting the authority of conscience.
This point about authority might allow a defence of the rational supremacy of conscience.
Reid argues that if we accept moral principles in their application to other people, but deny their application to ourselves, we rely on some assumption about what is special about ourselves. But when we think about it honestly, we reject this assumption. This argument presupposes that we rest our claims against others on authoritative principles. Hence we might avoid the conclusion by denying we rely on authoritative principles in our treatment of others; we might claim to be simply asserting our desires against them. Reid assumes that we cannot escape his conclusion in this way, if we admit that we are rational agents who guide our actions by authoritative principles.
Much more needs to be said in defence of this argument. One needs to show, for instance, that morality expresses an impartial and authoritative conception of what people deserve and are entitled to, so that it binds anyone who makes claims against others on the basis of entitlement. Butler briefly defends his view that this conception of morality underlies the exceptions to utilitarianism. Reid’s argument will be convincing only if he shows that Butler’s view gives an account of the basic principle of morality. Like Price, he sketches an argument that Kant explores more fully.
- some of the issues in the debate between rationalists and sentimentalists. This debate begins with Hobbes’s attack on a traditional view of the relation of morality to human nature.
This traditional view is contained in Suarez’s defence of Aquinas’ general position. Though Suarez does not agree with Aquinas on all the main questions of moral and political theory, he defends some of the main claims that distinguish Aquinas from his voluntarist critics and from Hobbes and his successors.
In Suarez’s view, principles of morality
    - describe what is appropriate for rational nature, which is not constituted by anyone’s beliefs or desires. He takes this conception to be equivalent to the next conception of them. The first claim is more prominent in Suarez. Sentimentalists reject the first claim. In their view, morality depends on will or sentiment, or both, not simply on facts about rational nature and what is appropriate for it. Some rationalists also reject the first claim. They agree that moral principles describe facts not constituted by human choice, will, desire, or sentiment. But Clarke, Price, and Reid reject the connexion between morality and rational nature. In their view, moral principles are true about moral facts that have no essential reference to rational nature; their rightness does not depend on the relation of morality to anything outside it. This element is restored by Butler in his account of morality, which comes much closer to Suarez’s account.
But Price and Reid follow Clarke in deleting the appeal to nature. Once the appeal to rational nature is dropped, we have nothing further to argue about if we ask whether a purported moral principle is true or not. We have to see the answer to such questions by inspection, since we have nothing we can infer it from. It is understandable, then, that the rationalists are also intuitionists about our knowledge of moral principles. 
    - principles of practical reason aiming at the human good. The second is more prominent in Aquinas; but, given the view of rational nature common to Aquinas and Suarez, the two claims agree.
- If Suarez is right, moral facts may be facts about human beings, or, more broadly, about rational beings. This is not completely obvious; for we might argue that facts about rational beings can be completely stated without any reference to what is fitting for their nature.
Suarez does not take this view; he believes that the nature of rational beings determines what is fitting for them, so that an account of all the facts about human nature will determine the facts about fittingness. Whatever metaphysical status we attribute to facts about human and rational nature must also be attributed to moral facts.
Since the rationalists reject this connexion with facts about rational nature, they cannot say anything further about the sorts of facts that moral facts are; hence, they must regard them as sui generis. This metaphysical claim is expressed in their claim that moral properties are indefinable. Reid provides a fuller and more articulate defence of this position than Clarke and Price provide. He argues, taking up suggestions of Price, that moral truths are not the only ones of which we must give an intuitionist account. Since empiricism, in his view, cannot account for our knowledge of the external world, and since we have to rely on intuition here too, we cannot reasonably object to an intuitionist treatment of moral knowledge. Reid does not explicitly reject Butler’s naturalism, insofar as it supports claims about the superior status of self-love and the supremacy of conscience. But he does not use naturalism against intuitionism.
