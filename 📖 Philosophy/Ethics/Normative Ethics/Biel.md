- Biel includes among things ‘naturally known’ as part of natural law both:
    - the necessary consequences of the principles
    - subordinate precepts - non-necessary consequences that are ‘very consonant’ with the principles
- Given Biel’s conception of the subordinate principles as highly consonant with the higher principles, it is reasonable for him to understand dispensations more narrowly than Scotus understands them. The only two types of dispensation that he allows are the revocation of a law and its clarification (631 G 1–4) He rejects dispensations that would give permission to violate a precept without revoking it. This last kind of dispensation is the kind that Scotus and Ockham seem to allow; hence Biel does not seem to agree with them about what dispensations are possible.
