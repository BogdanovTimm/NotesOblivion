# Definition

The **predicate refer to the property** that our beliefs come to more accurately represent **if**:
- we **find out more about the property** to which the term might refer as a result  of the causal connection
- we **revise our views** purporting to be  about that referent so that **they are closer to true**
- this is a **regular  process**

The **referent** of a term **need not** satisfy some uniquely determining **description** understood by the speaker and codified in its sense. A speaker may  even think that the referent of her term is essentially one kind of thing and  not the kind of thing it in fact essentially is. For example, Dalton (a pioneering chemist) would have defnied atoms as the smallest indivisible particles  of stuff (Burge, 1986). But as we know, atoms can be divided. Boyd’s account  offers an explanation of why we nonetheless take him to be talking about  what we are talking about when we talk of atoms. Both he and we are regulated by atoms so that our use of the term ‘atom’ is in an epistemically  virtuous feedback loop with atoms, and that feedback loop is partly responsible for our having discovered that atoms are divisible.

It is worth noting that the postulated regulation seems to be social in  nature. Any given individual’s epistemic access to most kinds and properties  will be mediated by the epistemic access of other members of her community.  The process of correcting and expanding our beliefs expressed using a scientific kind term is a group project and when it works it is a social accomplishment.

## Homeostatic relationship

When there is `X` - then there will be `Y`. When there is `Y` - there will be `X`.
Example: the presence of sea  anemones and the presence of hermit crabs. Hermit crabs and anemones  have a symbiotic relationship. Each does something that benefits the other,  and each does things that increase the likelihood that the other will flourish.  The crabs provide food for anemones that they allow to hitch rides on their  backs. And the anemones help the crabs repel predators such as octopuses.  Because of this relationship you are likely to find one where you find the  other. And the two properties, there being an anemone nearby and there  being a hermit crab nearby, tend to go together. They stand in a homeostatic  relationship in which each promotes the presence of the other.

# Pros

Direct Reference theorists can thus [[Moore's Open Question]] test as a test for sameness of  meaning or for sameness of referent, because both speaker and community, to which speaker belongs, may change referent
