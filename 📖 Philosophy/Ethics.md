# Meta-Ethics

## Realism vs Anti-Realism vs Quasi-Realism (Metaphysic of Moral)

Whether moral is objective:

- `Realism` \- moral is objective
- `Quasi-Realism` -
- `Anti-Realism` \- moral is not objective

## Cognitivism vs Non-Cognitivism vs Semi-Cognitivism (Philosophy of Language of Moral)

Whether statements about moral are facts (eg. whether they can be true or false), or they are meaningless:

- `Cognitivism` \- statements about moral can be true or false, they are same as statements such as 'Ontario is the capital city of Canada':
- `Semi-Cognitivism` \- statements about moral are just expression of attitudes, but they also can be true or false
- `Non-Cognitivism` \- statements about moral can't be true or false, they are just:
    - `Radical Emotivism` \- expressions of our emotions
    - `Prescriptivism` \- just prescriptions that can not be true or false (like 'you, go here!' can't be true or false)

## Naturalism vs Non-Naturalism (Epistemology of Moral)

Both Naturalism and Non-Naturalism imply Cognitivism and Realism

Can moral facts be found in our experience, intuitions, a-priory field on knowledge, or in someone's opinions:

- `Naturalism` \- Realism + Cognitivism - there are moral facts, they are objective and they can be found in our experience:
- `Non-Naturalism` \- Realism + Cognitivism - there are moral facts, they are objective and they can't be found in our experience (but can be found somewhere else):
    - `Intuitionism` \- they only can be found in our intuitions
    - `Rationalism` \- they only can be found in a-priori field of knowledge

## Relativism

Relativism implies Cognitivism and Anti-Realism

`Relativism` \- Cognitivism + Anti-Realism - there are moral facts, but they are not objective and they can be found in:
- `Cultural Relativism` \- cultures
- `Subjectivism` \- individual's opinions
- `Ideal Observer Theory` -
- `Divine Command Theory` \- God's commands

## Particular examples

`Intuitionism` \- Cognitivism + Realism + Non-Naturalism - there are moral facts, they are objective and they can't be found in our experience, but they only can be found in our intuitions

`Rationalism` \- Cognitivism + Realism + Non-Naturalism - there are moral facts, they are objective and they can't be found in our experience, but they only can be found in a-priori field of knowledge

`Cultural Relativism` \- Cognitivism + Anti-Realism + Relativism - there are moral facts, but they are not objective and they can be found in cultural norms

`Subjectivism` \- Cognitivism + Anti-Realism + Relativism - there are moral facts, but they are not objective and they can be found in individuals' opinions

`Ideal Observer Theory` \- Cognitivism + ?Anti-Realism? - there are some ideal moral agent that knows (or determines) what is good

`Error Theory` \- Cognitivism + Anti-Realism - there are moral facts, but because there is no objective one of them - they are all false and we can do nothing about it

`Divine Command Theory` \- Cognitivism + ?Anti-Realism? - God knows (or determines) what is good

`Constructivism` \- Cognitivism + Anti-Realism - there are no objective moral facts by itself, but we can made them up by reasoning

`Existentialism` \- It is one where we acknowledge and own up to our freedom, take full responsibility for our choices, and act in such a way as to help others realize their freedom.

`Revolutionary Fictionalism` \- Error Theory + we can change our moral language to Hermeneutic Fictionalism and then it will be ok

`Hermeneutic Fictionalism` \- to murder is bad = lets pretend that murder is bad

`Radical Emotivism` \- to murder is bad = BOOO MURDER!

`Sophisticated Emotivism` -

`Projectivism` -

`Norm-Expressivism` \- to murder is bad = I accept that to murder is bad

`Plan-Expressivism` \- to murder is bad = I will not do murder at any circumstances

# Normative Ethic

## Deontic

First, we have some pre-defined rules or pre-defined good, and then, based on these rules or good, someone's act became good or bad:

### Deontology

There are some rules that divide all actions to obligatory, indifferent and impermissible. Even if consequences of impermissible action are good - you can't do that:

- `Agent centered` \- you can't do something because there are some specific obligations for your social roles (you must care about your children):
    - `Intent focused` \- only your intents makes certain actions good or bad: you should not act with intentions to do something bad, even if it will lead to something good (you can't kill 1 to save 5)
    - `Action focused` \- you are always guilty if your actions lead to something bad, except:
        - Omitting - when you didn't help people you didn't know
        - Allow - you did something bad, but if was a will of someone else and leads to good consequences
        - Enable - you did something bad, but someone is threatening you
        - Redirect - you killed 1 people instead of 5
        - Accelerate - you did something that would be done in any case (to prevent a painful death)
    - `Intent-Action focused` \- you guilty only if all criterias of action based and intent based theories are true (so, you can't kill a dictator, because it will harm his rights, but you can allow him to kill others because you not directly kill other people)
- `Patient centered` \- you can't do something because other peoples have rights, that everyone must respect
    - `Kantian Ethics`
    - `Divine Command Theory` (maybe there are 2 of them)

### Consequentialism

Only consequences of our acts matter:

- `Actual` vs `Expected` consequentialism:
    - `Actual` \- we should judge based only on consequences (we can make distinction that it is bad, but not blameworthy, though)
    - `Expected`:
        - `Intended` consequentialism - the bad choice includes the actor's intent to do something bad
        - `Foreseeable` aka `Predictable` consequentialism - the bad choice includes that the actor could foresee bad consequences
        - `Probability` consequentialism - the good choice is the choice that has best probability of leading to our pre-defined ultimate good
        - `Proximate` consequentialism - the bad choice includes that no one helps you to do something bad (therefore, if you sell a bomb to a terrorist - you did not do something bad)
- `Hedonistic` vs `Pluralistic` consequentialism - does only pleasures matter (one or different kinds of pleasures) or something else (desires, human rights (it is getting close to patient-centered Deontology), for example)?
- `Direct` aka `Act` vs `Rules` consequentialism - should we judge people's particular acts or we should create some rules, based on which they act? (Rule consequentialism may be a form of Deontology)
- `Maximizing` vs `Improving` consequentialism - whether act should have the best consequences to be the good one (for every question there is only 1 good action) or it should have consequences better than average one (for every question there are more than 1 good action)?
- `Universal` vs `Particular` consequentialism - should act be evaluated based on an effect on every people or on only a some set of people?
- `Evaluative` vs `Non-Evaluative` consequentialism - should we judge only based on ethical properties or on ethical properties + something else?
- `Equal` vs `Privileged` consequentialism - do every people (animal) count the same or some of them are more important? (give-well problem)
- `Agent-Neutral` aka `Objective` vs `Agent-Relative` aka `Subjective` consequentialism - whether we must decide what will cause best consequences from all-people's perspective or only from a perspective of an agent of an action?
- `Aggregate` vs `Overall` aka `World` aka `Holistic` consequentialism - should we count only direct consequences of our action> Or we should count not just consequences that will be right after some action, but also consequences that will go further in a future? (though when we do harm to a bad man, we don't do something bad because if we will not do this, the overall happiness will be less)
- `Total` vs `Averaged` consequentialism - whether to give a $1 to a 1000 people is better than to give a $999 dollar to the one? (Derek Parfit repugnant conclusion)

`Classic Utilitarianism`: Actual, Hedonism, Direct aka Act, Universal, Evaluative, Equal, Maximizing, Total, Agent-Neutral

### Virtue Ethics

First, we have a pre-defined ideal person with which we can compare our acts:

- `Eudamonist` Virtue Ethics
    - `Aristotle` \- you must both have virtues and external goods
    - `Stoics, Plato` \- only virtues matters for a good life (you don't need to be healthy or wealth)
    - `Epicureans` \- you need to be virtuous and not be addicted to pleasures
    - `Skeptics` \- to be free from any pleasure or pain is the ultimate good
- `Non-Eudamonist` Virtue Ethics:
    - `Agent-based` aka `Target-centered` Virtue Ethics:
        - `Motivational` theories - whether somebody is good or bad is determined based on people's intents
        - `Paragon` Virtue Ethics - whether somebody is good or bad is determined based on comparing somebody's actions with actions of an ideal manÂ  (in fact, it means just that we care only about the consequences of some action)
    - `Target-centered` Virtue Ethics:
        - `Perfectionism` \- you must choose an action that targets all virtues
        - `Permissivism` \- you must choose an action that targets some pre-defined amount of virtues
        - `Minimalism` \- you must choose an action that targets at least 1 virtue
- `Intent` \- you must have good intent to do something
- You don't need to always produce good, you need to produce it in most situations
