Even if we have coherent believes, we can't be Shure that we know something rather than we just guess it. 

For example, suppose that there are a broken watches - they always shows 16:00. I don't know that they are broken. Somebody asks me 'what time is it?'. I look at the clock and say 'it is 16:00'. And, because of my lucky nature, it is true that now is 16:00. But, because watches are broken, my right answer was just a lucky guess rather than  a knowledge.
