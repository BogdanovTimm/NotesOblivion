# Definition

`X` supervenes on `Y` = `X` may change **only** if `Y` has changed.

Also, every `X` supervenes on `X`.

Identity between `X` and `Y` means that `X` supervenes on `Y` && `Y` supervenes on `X`.

# Types of Supervenience

There are 2 types of supervenience:
- `Global` - every `X` supervenes on every `Y`
- `Local` - `X1` supervenes only on `Y1`, `X2` supervenes only on `Y2`
