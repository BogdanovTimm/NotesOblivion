1. Let me introduce a peace from my monography.
2. The title is 'Very Good Title'. 
3. The author is John Doe
4. It was written in 2020 and published by the Routledge.
5. *Purpose (part) -* the purpose of this text is to show that modern Universities plays a role in the globalizatoin.
6. *Subject of the material -* the subject of this material is 'the process of globalization'
7. *Contents of the article* - The material can be divided in to several parts:
	- In the first author writes about the change in the idea of a University
	- In the second part author deescribes globalization
    - In the final part, he writes about the metaphors of liquids and solids
8. *Main idea -* the main idea of this text is that modern Universities are not work like in the Medieval. Author uses metaphors of liquid and solid.
9. To support his claim he gives next arguments:
	- By asking volunteers about Milgram's experiment (that have been criticised for being unethical in the science world), he has found, that their answers falls into either of these 2 categories. This was confirmed by factor analysis.
10. *Author's vocabulary* - Vocabulary is rather poetic and modern, with a main emphasis on the metaphors describing processes.
11. I found this article meaningless and pointless. There is no useful information or an intresting argument within it. The irony is: the author uses the metaphor of liquids and it is the best definition of this text.
12. *Conclusion (importance, how useful) -* To draw a conclusion, I would like to say that altough mostly I found articles about Universities and their relation to Politics as very intresting, this one raises only 1 desire: forget about it as soon as possible.
