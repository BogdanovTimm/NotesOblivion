2. The title is 'Interest cannot be forced: the role of academic motivation and teaching styles in the development of students crutical thinking'.
3. The authors are Koreshnikova and Avdeeva
4. It was written in 2022 and published by the Educational Studies Moscow.
5. The relevance of this work stems from an importance of growing the critical thinking as a main competence of a member of a scientific and educational community.
6. The purpose of this work is to find which educaitonal strategy best supports the development of critical thinking.
7. The subject of this work is 'the process of developing critical thinking'
8. The main idea of this part is that different educational strategies have different effects on academic motivation and, in the effect, on the development of critical thinkiong. Authors note that previous studies considered only extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, not caring about the other types of motivation that were developed in the theory of self-determnitaion of  E.L Desi and R.M. Rayan. Authors claim that only types of intrinsic motivation positively assiciated with critical thinking and that the constructivist style of teaching has the most effectiveness in relation to the development of a given construct.
9. To support their claims, Koreshnqikova dnd Avdeeva give next arguments:

10. Conclusion (importance, how useful) - To draw a conclusion, I would like to say that despite the authorsâ€™ attempts to identify additional types of academic motivation positively associated with CT within the subscale of extrinsic motivation, it was proved that only types of intrinsic motivation were positively associated with the construct under study.
