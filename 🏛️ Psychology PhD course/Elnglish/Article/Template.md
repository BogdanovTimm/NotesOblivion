1. Let me introduce peace from my monography. 
2. The title is 'Making Moral Judgements'. 
3. The author Donelson R Forsyth
4. It was written in 2020 and published by the Routledge.
5. This work is relevant in a 2 main aspects: it tries to construct psychological investigation based on philosophical theory and connect it with practice. Forsynth not only sums up up-to-date approaches of studying peoples' moral positions, but develops his own, called 'Ethic position theory', together with 'Ethic Potition Questionnaire'.
6. Purpose (part) - the purpose of this text is to show that ethic has his own place in human psychology.
7. Subject of the material - the subject of this material is identical to its name - 'the process of making moral judgements'
8. Main idea - the main idea of this text is that ethics not only the concern of a few people - philosopher, but that everybody tries to find the answer for the questions of ethics. Forsyth claims that he has found 2 core clusters of the Moral Judgements-making: whether or not some action hurt somebody or whether or not the action breaks some common rules.
9. To support his claim he gives next arguments:
	- By asking volunteers about Milgram's experiment (that have been criticised for being unethical in the science world), he has found, that their answers falls into either of these 2 categories. This was confirmed by factor analysis.
	- Modern moral philosophy is divided onto 2 main positions: utilitarianism and deontology. The first says that action is moral if it has good consequences while the second one objects that good or mad consequences are not relevant, we should concern only about following rules.
    - Forsyth shows that Piaget's theory of moral development shows that younger children base their moral judgements on the consequences of the action, but older ones weight moral principles more.
    - He shows that Kohlberg also notes that moral dilemmas occur when 'obedience to rules conflict with the welfare of others'.
    - Next, Forsyth presents his 'Ethic Position Questionnaire' that is based on the responses of more than 30,000 adults who have completed it.
    - Second factor analysis of the measure reaffirmed that the items clustered into two coherent subgroups. 
    - Cronbach’s alpha—an index of strength of the relationships among the items found that they were sufficient (0.80 and 0.73, respectively). 
    - To determine if respondet's scores remained consistent over time, they go through test 2 times. This test-retest reliability was also adequate.
    - Psychological study of other authors report the test-retest correlations even more than that.
10. Conclusion (importance, how useful) - To draw a conclusion, I would like to say that this book not only important for the psychology as a whole, but also for me personally. I've found that the idea of using philosophical enquieries in psychological sudies may be productive and empirically adequate.
