# Self-representation



1. My name is Timofey. I live in Pskov. I graduated school in 2017. Next, I got a specialist degree in psychology in Pskov State University in 2022. The theme of my graduation paper was 'Personal conditioning of behavioral styles in conflict situations'. Back then, I was especially interested in psychoanalysis and philosophy.



2. Now I am a postgraduate student of the Chair of Psychology and Child Development Support.
3. The theme of my dissertation is 'Adolescent student worldview attitudes under the conditions of involvement in media discourse'.
4. My scientific advisor is Parfenova Nadezhda Borisovna, PhD in Psychology, assistant professor of the Chair of Psychology and Child Development Support.



5. In my investigation, I want to: 
    - synthesize previous works about worldview and psychological aspects of envolving in the mediadiscourse
    - expand theoretical basis of psychological science in the worldview field using current development of moral philosophy 
    - apply it to practice by developing test that will help investigate student's worldview attitudes more clearly. 



6. Currently I've: 
    - put forward a hypothesis
    - defined dissertation's structure
    - found appropiate theoretical base
7. The hypothesis is: there is a connection between adolescent student worldview attitudes and their involving in the media discource.
8. My research will have 3 parts: a theoretical, an empirical and a practical ones. Currently I am working on empirical part: developing of a survey for defining a structure of students' values.
9. Recently, I took part in 2 psychological conferences for students: 
    - one was in Pskov State University and 
    - other was in Moscow State University of Psychology and Education - Materials from the las–µ one should be published soon as an article named 'Value-Meaning and action components of the worldview of student youth'.



10. I hope it may help to:
    - minimize bad consequences of media discourse
    - improve the modern higher educational process
