The test uses the following scales: 
- **P-score** – This score represents the degree to which an individual uses higher order moral reasoning. The P score is calculated on the basis of only the ranking data and can range from 0 to 99. An average score for senior high school students is in the 30's. For a college student, an average score is in the 40's. The same averages apply to the N2 score below (Bebeau and Thoma, 2003; Rest, Thoma, Narvaez, and Bebeau, 1997). The P-score is the proportion of items selected that appeal to moral ideals and/or theoretical frameworks for resolving complex moral issues, specifically, items that appeal to:
    - consensus-building procedures, 
    - insisting on due process, 
    - safeguarding minimal basic rights, 
    - and organizing social arrangements in terms of appealing to ideals.
- **N2 score** – Like the P-score, the N2 score is based on acquiring more sophisticated moral thinking, but the N2 score also reflects the extent to which individuals reject ideas because they are simplistic or biased. The score is adjusted so that it is on the same scale as the P-score (Bebeau and Thoma, 2003). 
- **Personal Interest Score** – This score represents the degree to which an individual uses the least sophisticated levels of moral reasoning. It is the proportion of an individual's selected items that appeal to:
    - the direct advantages for the actor, 
    - the fairness of simple exchanges, 
    - the good or evil intentions of the parties, 
    - the party’s concern for maintaining friendships and good relationships, 
    - and maintaining approval (Bebeau and Thoma, 2003; Rest et al., 1997). 
- **Maintain Norms Score** – The Maintain Norms Score measures mid-level moral reasoning. It is the proportion of selected items in which the focus is on maintaining:
    - the existing legal system, 
    - existing roles, 
    - and formal organizational structures (Bebeau and Thoma, 2003). 
- **Utilizer Score** – The Utilizer Score or U-score represents the consistency between items endorsed as important and the action choice in a dilemma. The U-score is scaled on a range of −1 (low utilization) to +1 (high utilization), though the typical range from large sample
