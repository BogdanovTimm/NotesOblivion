- Among the more recently developed survey measures, the Moral Foundations Questionnaire[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_psychology#cite_note-Graham2011-48) is a widely used survey measure of the five moral intuitions proposed by [Moral Foundations Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_Foundations_Theory "Moral Foundations Theory"): care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and sanctity/degradation. The questions ask respondents to rate various considerations in terms of how relevant they are to the respondent's moral judgments. The purpose of the questionnaire is to measure the degree to which people rely upon each of the five moral intuitions (which may coexist).
