Values - conceptions of the desirable that guide the way social actors (e.g.organisational leaders, policymakers, individual persons) select actions, evaluate people an events, and explain their actions and evaluations.

# Krisiansen and Hotte

Kristiansen and Hotte[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_psychology#cite_note-Kristiansen&Hotte1996-67) reviewed many research articles regarding people's values and attitudes and whether they guide behavior. With the research they reviewed and their own extension of Ajzen and Fishbein's [theory of reasoned action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_reasoned_action "Theory of reasoned action"), they conclude that value-attitude-behavior depends on the individual and their moral reasoning. Another issue that Kristiansen and Hotte discovered through their research was that individuals tended to "create" values to justify their reactions to certain situations, which they called the "value justification hypothesis".[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_psychology#cite_note-Kristiansen&Hotte1996-67) Their theory is comparable to Jonathan Haidt's [social intuitionist theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_intuitionism "Social intuitionism"),[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_psychology#cite_note-Haidt2001-36) where individuals justify their intuitive emotions and actions through post-hoc moral reasoning.

Kristiansen and Hotte also found that independent selves had actions and behaviors that are influenced by their own thoughts and feelings, but [Interdependent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdependent "Interdependent") selves have actions, behaviors and self-concepts that were based on the thoughts and feelings of others. Westerners have two dimensions of emotions, activation and pleasantness. The Japanese have one more, the range of their interdependent relationships. Markus and Kitayama found that these two different types of values had different motives. Westerners, in their explanations, show self-bettering biases. Easterners, on the other hand, tend to focus on "other-oriented" biases.[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_psychology#cite_note-Kristiansen&Hotte1996-67)
