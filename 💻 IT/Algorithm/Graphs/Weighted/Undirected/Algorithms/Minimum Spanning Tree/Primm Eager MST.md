# What it is?

Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is a graph that can be made from a given graph:
- Minimum Spanning Tree graph will have all nodes from original graph
- Minimum Spanning Tree graph will have minimal amount of connections between nodes such that all nodes will be connected

Primm's algorithm is faster than the Kruskal's one.
# Code

This code uses Primm's Eager version of this algorithm:

I am too lazy to implement this. You can find it here:
