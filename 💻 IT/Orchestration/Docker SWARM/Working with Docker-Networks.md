You can also use a `host` network for a SWARM-Service, by passing `--network host` to the `docker service create` command. In this case, control traffic (traffic related to managing the SWARM-Cluster and the SWARM-Service) is still sent across an Docker-Overlay-Network, but the individual SWARM-Service containers send data using the Docker-Daemon's-Host-Network and ports. This creates some extra limitations. For instance, if a service container binds to port 80, only one service container can run on a given swarm node.
