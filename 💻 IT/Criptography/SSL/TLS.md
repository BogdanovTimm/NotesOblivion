TLS is an enhancement of the TCP-Protocol that adds an encryption to it.

TLS do:
- Prevent somebody (including your ISP) of seeing your data in packets

TLS can't do:
- Can't hide your IP-Address from the Website you use (use Proxy + TLS, or TOR + TLS for this)
- Can't hide IP-Address of the Website you visited from your ISPs (use Proxy + TLS, or TOR + TLS for this)
