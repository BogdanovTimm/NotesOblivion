#                  How it works

RAM:
* Inputs:
    * Arrays of bits of data
    * 1 bit flag that says whether to read data from a given address and output it in the next iteration of an internal clock or to write a new one into it and than gave a new one as an output in the new iteration of iternal clock
    * Address of register to work with
    * Clock
* Outputs:
    * Arrays of bits of data
