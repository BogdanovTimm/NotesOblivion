#                Thread context switch

With processes, we saved state to a process control block (PCB); now, weâ€™ll need one or more thread control blocks (TCBs) to store the state of each thread of a process. There is one major difference, though, in the context switch we perform between threads as compared to processes: the address space remains the same (i.e., there is no need to switch which page table we are using).
