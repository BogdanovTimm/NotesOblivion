- Use signed numbers for working with bits

#                  Representation

`{4, 5}` means:
```
76543210
--------
00110000
```

#                  << and >>

`X << 3` is same as `X * 2^3`
```
00011 << 2
=
01100
```
If new bits will not fit into number of allowed bits - they will simply be dropped

`X << 3` is same as `X / 2^3`
```
01100 >> 2 
=
00011
```

#                  ~

Simply chooses each bit to other value:
```
 A 101100
~A 010011
```

#                  Cool stuff


- `A \ B` = `A - (A&B)` 
- `V + 1` = `0`, where `V = 11111111`
- `A ^ B` = `(A - (A&B)) + (B - (A&B))`
- `A ^ B` = `A + B - 2*(A&B)`
- `A | B` = `A + B - (A&B)`
- `~B` = `V - B`
- `~B` = `V - B`
- `-B` = `~B + 1`
- Only in unsigned: `A + ~A` = `âˆ’1`
- Only in unsigned: `A + (~A + 1)` = `0`

#                  Working with bits

You can work with bits, using them within an unsigned int:

```C
enum corvid { 0 = magpie , 1 = raven , 2 = jay , 3 = chough , 4 = corvid_num , }; 
#define FLOCK_MAGPIE (1U << magpie)         // 0000000000000000000000000000001
#define FLOCK_RAVEN  (1U << raven)          // 0000000000000000000000000000010
#define FLOCK_JAY    (1U << jay)            // 0000000000000000000000000000100
#define FLOCK_CHOUGH (1U << chough)         // 0000000000000000000000000001000
#define FLOCK_EMPTY  0U                     // 0000000000000000000000000000000
#define FLOCK_FULL   ((1U << corvid_num)-1) // 0000000000000000000000000000111

int main(void) {
    unsigned flock = FLOCK_EMPTY; // flock = ...00000000
    if (something) {
        flock |= FLOCK_JAY;       // flock = ...00000100
    }
    if (flock & FLOCK_CHOUGH) {// if flock = ...????1???
        do_something_chough_specific(flock);
    }
```
