Of the bits bi that are 1, the one with minimal index i is called the least-significant bit setC, and the one with the highest index is the most-significant bit setC. For example, for an unsigned type with p = 16, the value 240 would have b4 = 1, b5 = 1, b6 = 1, and b7 = 1. All other bits of the binary representation are 0, the least-significant bit set i is b4, and the most-significant bit set is b7.
