#                  What it is

- Works with connection-oriented and connectionless services (more often with connection-oriented)
- Allows many programms on the same PC to use same lower-layer protocols
- Glues data from differet programms to 1 flow before sending
- Splits single flow of data into different data for programms after receiving
- Splits big chuncks of data into smaller chunks
- Lost transmission detection and handling
- Manages the rate at which data is sent to ensure that the receiving device is not overwhelmed
- Reliability and flow control features (message was not changed during transmission)
