#                  What it is?

- the only one where data is physically moved across the network interface
- The physical layer defines a number of network functions that:
    - Transform bits into signals that can be sent over the network
    - Perform Bit-level repackaging of Data Layer frames
    - Detects Errors
- All hardware must have some relation to the physical layer in order to send data over the networ
- Together with Data layer, it defines the details of operation of the hardware
