#                  What it is

- LAN, both wired and wireless
- Creates frames that will be sent over the network at physical layer
- Addressing: labeling information with a particular destination location using MAC-Address
- Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) fields is often employed to allow the station receiving data to detect if it was received correctly
- Dealts with transmitting data if PCs are on same Network
- Deals with MAC-Addresses that refer to local physical devices
