Protocol on the Meduim Access Control Sublayer of the OSI.

The MAC layer performs transmission scheduling, that is, the requesting and use of the radio transmission slots. 

The MAC sublayer also performs additional error detection/correction functions, including the use of redundant bit transmission as a forward  error-correction technique. The amount of redundancy can be adapted to channel  conditions.
