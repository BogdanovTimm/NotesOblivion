Snort is a public-domain, open source IDS with hundreds of thousands of existing  deployments [Snort 2012; Koziol 2003]. It can run on Linux, UNIX, and Windows  platforms. It uses the generic sniffing interface libpcap, which is also used by Wireshark and many other packet sniffers. It can easily handle 100 Mbps of traffic; for  installations with gibabit/sec traffic rates, multiple Snort sensors may be needed.
