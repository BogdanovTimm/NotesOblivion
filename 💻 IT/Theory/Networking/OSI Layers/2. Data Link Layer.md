#                  What it is

- LAN, both wired and wireless
- Creates frames that will be sent over the network at physical layer
- Addressing: labeling information with a particular destination location using MAC-Address
- Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) fields is often employed to allow the station receiving data to detect if it was received correctly
- Dealts with transmitting data if PCs are on same Network
- Deals with MAC-Addresses that refer to local physical devices









#                  Types of Network links

* Point-To-Point Links:
    * PPP  Protocol
    * HDLC Protocol
* Broadcast Links:
    * Wireless LAN
    * Multiple Access Protocols:
        * Channel Partitioning Protocols:
           * FDM Protocols - allow 2 or more users to send something via single link by creating different logical links (by using different physical frequences)
           * TDM Protocols - allow 2 or more users to send something via single link by concurrency
           * CDMA Protocols - allow 2 or more users to send something via single link by coding each user differently
        * Random Access Protocols - allow 2 or more users to send something via a single link by allowing each user to send data in parallel. When a collision occurs - then user wait random time and retransmitt its data:
            * ALOHA Protocol
            * CSMA Protocols:
               * Ethernet
        * Taking-Turns Protocols:
           * Polling Protocol:
               * Bluetooth
               * Token-Passing Protocol:
                   * DFFI
                   * IEEE






#                  Sublayers

Data Link Layers has its sublayers.

##                 Logical Link Control (LLC)

What it is:
- Functions required for the establishment and control of logical links between local devices on a network.

##                 Media Access Control (MAC)









#                  Techonologies

- Ethernet
- Token Ring
- FDDI
- Wi-Fi
- HomePNA
- ATM
- TCP/IP's Serial Link Interface Protocol (SLIP)
- Point-To-Point Protocol (PPP)
- STP - finds shortest non-loop path in network
