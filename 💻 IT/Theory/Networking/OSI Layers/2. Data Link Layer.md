#                  What it is

- LAN, both wired and wireless
- Creates frames that will be sent over the network at physical layer
- Addressing: labeling information with a particular destination location using MAC-Address
- Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) fields is often employed to allow the station receiving data to detect if it was received correctly
- Dealts with transmitting data if PCs are on same Network
- Deals with MAC-Addresses that refer to local physical devices









#                  Types of Network links

Types of Network links:
- Point-To-Point Links:
    - PPP  Protocol
    - HDLC Protocol
- Broadcast Links:
    - Wireless LAN
    - Multiple Access Protocols (Needed when 1 device receives data in parallel from different devices):
        - Channel Partitioning Protocols:
           - FDM Protocols - allow 2 or more users to send something via single link by creating different logical links (by using different physical frequences)
           - TDM Protocols - allow 2 or more users to send something via single link by concurrency
           - CDMA Protocols - allow 2 or more users to send something via single link by representing each bit of each sender as a some number of bits. When this bits-numbers are received simultaneously, they are added. But, we know how it was originaly transformed into a number, so we can find original bit-number and the original bit from it.
        - Random Access Protocols - allow 2 or more users to send something via a single link by allowing each user to send data in parallel. When a collision occurs - then user wait random time and retransmitt its data:
            - ALOHA Protocol
            - CSMA Protocols:
               - CSMA/CD - Ethernet
               - CSMA/CA - Wi-Fi - befre sending a data, the phone sends a RTS-frame to AP to say 'I want to send you something'. Then, AP sends the CTS-frame to all devices it sees to say 'now only phone can send me data'. Now, phone may start to send data. When phone finished, AP sends ACK-frame to say 'I've received everything, now I wait for the new device to send me a RTS-frame'.
        - Taking-Turns Protocols:
           - Polling Protocol:
               - Bluetooth
               - Token-Passing Protocol:
                   - DFFI
                   - IEEE






#                  Sublayers

Data Link Layers has its sublayers.

##                 Logical Link Control (LLC)

What it is:
- Functions required for the establishment and control of logical links between local devices on a network.

##                 Media Access Control (MAC)









#                  Techonologies

- Ethernet
- Token Ring
- FDDI
- Wi-Fi
- HomePNA
- ATM
- TCP/IP's Serial Link Interface Protocol (SLIP)
- Point-To-Point Protocol (PPP)
- STP - finds shortest non-loop path in network
