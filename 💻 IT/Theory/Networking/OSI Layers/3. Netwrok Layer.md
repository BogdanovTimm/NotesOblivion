#                  What it is

- Gettin gdata from one PC to another even if they are on different networks
- Dealing with Logical Addresses: IPs
- Creates datagrams aka packets with a network layer header
- Splits packages and send pieces to the data link layer. Then it will glue them together
- Get statuses about hosts or devices themselves
- Works with connection-oriented and connectionless services. Connectionless are more often.

#                  Types of organisation of Network Layer

Network Layer:
- Routing (Data Plane) - finding to which Networks every Output-NIC in Router leads (aka creating a Routing-Table):
    - Per-router - 
    - Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
- Forwarding (Control Plane) - final descision to which Output-NIC of Router to send a packet (or drop it) (aka creating a Forwarding-Table):
    - Per-router Control - it is when router itself works
    - Software-Defined Networking (SDN) - it is when a server works
