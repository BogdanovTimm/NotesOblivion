#                  What is the difference between Circuit and Packet Switching networks?

Networks:
- Circuit vs Packet Switching:
    - Circuit-Switching Networks - Once connection established, information is transmitted using one path. This also means that no one else can use this path.
    - Packet-Switching Networks - Once conneciton established, information is cut into packets. Each packet may use its own path. Also, it means that other also may use same path.
- Connection-Orientd vs Connectionless:
    - Connection-Orientd - establish connection before using Circuit-Switching Networks or Packet-Switching Networks. Examples: TCP, Telnet, ATM
    - Connecitonless - do not establish conneciton. Examples: UDP, IP
