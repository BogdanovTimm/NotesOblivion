#                  Public vs private

- `static int xPRIVATE_VARIABLEx = 1;` - Private (only in current file)
- `int xPACKAGE_PRIVATEx = 1` - Package Private (only in current module)
- Public:
    1. `int xPUBLIC_VARIABLEx = 1;` - Define in a module as a global one
    2. `extern xPUBLIC_VARIABLEx`
