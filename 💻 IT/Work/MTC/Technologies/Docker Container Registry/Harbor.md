#                  What it is?

It is the heap for the MTC-developed Docker-Images.

It is needed because if you have more than 1 Docker-Image (Composed-Docker-Image) consist of other Docker Images (Base-Docker-Images) - then you need to keep only 1 Base-Docker-Image, instead of 1 per each Composed-Docker-Image. Because of that, you need to keep Docker Images in a special way.
