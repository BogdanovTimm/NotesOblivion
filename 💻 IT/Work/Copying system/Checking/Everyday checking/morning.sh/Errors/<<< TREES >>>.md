#                  How to find it

There is a red `No jobs` under <<< TREES >>









#                  What it is?

There is an everyday-lsf-jobs that runs on every server in the `nc` queue.
There need to be a green today's date after 11AM. If there is a red `No jobs` - it means something has gone wrong.
