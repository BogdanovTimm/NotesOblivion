1. (Optional. If there is no connection yet) `./mc alias set 'xCONNETCION_NAMEx' 'https://minio.server.address.com:9000' 'admin' 'password'`
2. Add credentials of any user. Minio will use it to get all groups' and users' names (don't worry if it will not be right, you may change it later in WebUI)
```shell
./mc                                                 \
    idp                                              \
    ldap                                             \
    add                                              \
    xCONNETCION_NAMEx                                \
    server_addr="ldap.server.address.com"            \
    lookup_bind_dn="CN=Any User That May View Other Users,OU=Grandchild Group,OU=Child Group,OU=Parent Group,DC=domain,DC=mts,DC=com" \
    lookup_bind_password="xLDAP_USER_PASSWORDx"      \
    user_dn_search_base_dn="DC=domain,DC=mts,DC=com" \
    user_dn_search_filter="(sAMAccountName=%s)"
```
Where:
    - `lookup_bind_dn` - you may find it in Active Directory Users and Computers. You need to View/Advanced Features. Then you need to find your user using finder. Then you need to go to 'Member of' tab and choose Users. Then you need to go to 'Attribute Editor' tab and find 'distinguishedName'.
    - `user_dn_search_base_dn` - you may find it in Active Directory Users and Computers. You need to View/Advanced Features. Then you need to find 'Users' folder. Right click on 'Users'. Then you need to go to 'Attribute Editor' tab and find 'distinguishedName'. You need everything except "CN=Users"
