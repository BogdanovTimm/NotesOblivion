Generally, you should choose one of the following swap strategies:
- Assign swap space on your system, and configure the kernel to only permit swapping under high memory load
- Do not assign swap space on your system, and configure the kernel to disable swapping entirely

See Set vm.swappiness for instructions on configuring swap on your Linux system following these guidelines.
