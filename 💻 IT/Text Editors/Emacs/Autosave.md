# Autosave

Autosave is enabled by default. If your filename is `filename.txt`, then it saves current buffer in the file named `#filename.txt#`
If some file was changed, it will be showed by `-**-` at the Mode-Line
`Alt + x` and then `recover this file` to `#filename.txt#` into the `filename.txt`
