- Donâ€™t cast the return of `malloc()` and other functions. 
- Don't forget in `#include <stdlib.h>`
- Don't use `malloc()`. Dynamical allocation should be done with `calloc()`. This avoids another quarter of the problems with uninitialized objects. 

In fact, this mechanism creates storage instances that are only seen as byte arrays and do not have any interpretation as objects. They only acquire a type, once we store something.

- `void* malloc(size_to_allocate_in_bytes)`:
    - `double* address_of_variable = malloc(length * sizeof(*(variable)))` - simple variable
    - `double* address_of_array    = malloc(sizeof(double[length]))` - array
- `void free(void* ptr)`
- `void* calloc(size_t nmemb , size_t size)` - like `malloc()`, but also sets all bits to 0
- `void* realloc(void* ptr , size_t size)` - change size of allocated memory
- `void* aligned_alloc(size_t alignment , size_t size)` - `malloc()` using non-default alignment
