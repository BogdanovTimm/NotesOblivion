#                  /

##                 Do not

- Do not rely on `/` to produce values that has something after a dot if both numbers are `int`s. For example, `1 / 2` will produce 0.
- Do not divide by zero: `5 / 0` will produce undefined result

#                  %

##                 Do not

- Do not rely on it if even one of 2 numbers are minus signed. Read about it more
- Do not use it for floats (you can't. hahaha).

###                % for floats

`fmod()`

#                  Power

`pow()`
