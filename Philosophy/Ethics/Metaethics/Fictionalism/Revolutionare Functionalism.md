# Definition

People don't think like [[Hermeneutic Fictionalism]]. But we need to create a new way of talking about moral.

# Cons

If [[Philosophy/Ethics/Metaethics/Error Theory|Error Theory]] is true, then why we need to change our language practices? (We might argue that this is because not all normative claims are morals)
