## Way 1

`Good` = `Happiness`. Or `good` = `Happiness OR Health`

## Way 2

`Good` supervenes on `Happiness`. Or `good` supervenes on `Happiness OR Health`

# Pros

It does not requires any new human senses, as in [[Intuitionism]].

# Cons

- Even if 2 people agrees that Reductive Naturalism is true, they do not know whether `Good` = `Happiness` or `Good` = `Health`.
