# Definition

The simplest subjectivisms make the **contents of** those **judgements** be **about** the very **motives**  on which agents act when they do what is right or eschew what is wrong.

Types of Subjectivism:
- Which motives are important:
	- Speaker/Appraiser Subjectivism - One individualistic variant holds that the property of **being right** just **is** the  property of **being desired or approved** of by the speaker or appraiser.
	- Agent Subjectivism - Another adopts a similar view but says that the relevant **motives must belong to the  agent whose actions are being judged**, **not the speaker** of the utterance.
- Whether it needs to be motives of a group or of an individual:
	- Group Subjectivism
	- Agent Subjectivism

These types need to be combined to get `Appriser group subjectivism`.

# Assumptions

[[Internalism]] is true.

# Counter arguments

## Counter argument for Agent Subjectivism

If [[Mackie's argument of disagreement]] is true, then the fact that there can't be any disagreement between people, proves that the Error Theory is right.

## Counter argument for Speaker Subjectivism

If [[Hare's Translation Argument]] is true, then there are disagreement, according to our common sense. But subjectivism concludes that there are no disagreement.
