1. Moral judgements of 1 person can't conflict with moral judgement of another person.
2. The negation of ‘**Sam**’s action was **wrong**’ = the negation of ‘**I disapprove** of **Sam**’s action.’ `!(X is wrong) = I dissaprove (X is wrong))`
3. The negation of ‘**I disapprove** of **Sam**’s action’ = ‘**I don’t disapprove** of **Sam**’s action.’ `!(I dissaprove (X is wrong)) = !(I dissaprove (X is Y))`
4. Since ‘**Sam**’s action was **not wrong**’ is the negation of ‘**Sam**’s action was **wrong**,’ it should say the same thing. `!(X is wrong) = !(X is wrong)`
5. But then ‘**Sam**’s action was **not wrong**’ doesn’t attribute an attitude that conflicts with disapproval, it just denies the presence of the original attitude (in oneself).
