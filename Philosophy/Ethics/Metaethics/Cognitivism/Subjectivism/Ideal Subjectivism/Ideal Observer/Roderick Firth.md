# Definition

`X` is good if we imagine ideal observer that is impartial, consistent, and so on and try to find what he would say about `X`. So, we still use our approval or disapproval of `X`, but with some restrictions.

It is a dispositional analysis: `X` is `Y` if `X` elicit response `Z` from `A` in conditions `B`.

If it response-dependent theory.

# Assumptions

Defeasible morals/motives existence [[Internalism]] is true.

# Cons

- It is an empirical issue whether `X` is good or not. That means that empirical sciences like psychology will have something to contribute to assessing the view, though commonsense psychology  may also give us relevant information.
- It doesn't clear how an agent would be motivated or has reason to do something right
# Pros

- It does not need **indefeasible** [[Internalism]]
- Because of previous, it is protected from amoralist counterexamples
- [[Modal Problem]] is solved
- There are a lot less different moral conclusions that in Simple Subjectivism

# Further development

We can think of `right` not as `always right in all circumstances`, but as `best from available options`. That will save us from incoherence that same action may be both `required` and `forbidden`
