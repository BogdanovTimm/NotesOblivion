Network analyses of moral properties

# Definition

They hope to use the fact that our moral terms and concepts are so interconnected to provide a network analysis of each.

There is some moral commonplaces that competent moral thinkers can grasp (it means that it doesn't need for everybody to be able to grasp it). Moral commonplaces are about:
- interrelations between moral kinds and properties
- connections to natural objects, properties and relations

Next, we grab all of these moral common places into 1 big sentence - Ramsey sentence (after Frank Ramsey):
- we grab all these moral common places into 1 big sentence
- we write every moral term (rightness, goodness) that occurs in other parts of the sentence as a variable

[[Internalism]] may be accepted if it is accepted in some moral commonplaces.
