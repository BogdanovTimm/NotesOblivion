While the Cornell Realists by and large backed away from a priori philosophical analyses as a legitimate methodology for reducing moral properties  to natural properties, not everyone did. 

Some think there is a simpler  response: Rather than give up on such analyses in the face of the paradox  of analysis, we should just realize that a priori truths, including philosophical  analyses, can be unobvious. If we conceive of philosophical  analyses as something a speaker or thinker explicitly deploys when thinking  about the subject matter at hand, it can be hard to see how this is so. 

But  we need not suppose speakers using the word ‘right’ explicitly think of  rightness as satisfying the conditions laid out by a correct analysis of the  term. They may just deploy a tacit concept that guides them to think, speak,  and act with rightness in mind. Such speakers will have various inferential  dispositions involving rightness, dispositions to judge that certain kinds of  actions are right, dispositions to communicate such judgements and others  related to them, and dispositions to act in various ways upon learning that  something is right. The analysis of rightness might then just be a good way  to systematize and summarize the tacit knowledge deployed by thinkers who use the word as they communicate, think, and act. 

The analysis will be  adequate to these purposes just as long as the knowledge that users rely on in using that concept is derivable from the analysis and that nothing that is not part of that tacit knowledge is derivable. If that condition is met we  can use the analysis to capture the sum total of that knowledge in a relatively  simple way. 

This picture makes it less surprising that competent speakers  who know what they mean might have doubts about a correct analysis. For  it is not always obvious what best summarizes such a body of tacit knowledge, even when one is in possession of that whole body. And if the range  of tacit knowledge that we’re trying to capture is sufficiently complex, even  the most competent users of the concept might be unsure whether any  statement of it is actually complete. It could turn out that the best summary  is just too long to take in all at once when made explicit. 

A move like this is available to proponents of most a priori philosophical  analyses of moral concepts and properties. 

# Pros

It provides a rejoinder to the  Open Question Argument consistent with an a priori metaethical  methodology.
