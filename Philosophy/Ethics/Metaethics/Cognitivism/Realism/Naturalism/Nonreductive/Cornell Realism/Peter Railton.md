It is a kind of is a [[Ideal Subjectivism]]. 

We start with what a person wants for herself. These are her subjective interests. But these interests may be based on false information or misunderstanding of her situation, or perhaps a failure of imagination  about what she wants. 

So we cleanse and supplement those desires by asking  what she would want were she to be fully informed, to understand the situation well, and to fully exercise her imagination. If a present desire is based  on false information it won’t be relevant. And if new information would  add some desire that she does not currently have, that will be relevant. What we’re concerned about is what she would want herself to do in her actual  circumstances if she were to think of herself in those circumstances from  much more ideal conditions. 

We are asking a counterfactual question, often  even about what she would want in circumstances she can’t realistically  expect to be in. But her desires in those unrealistic circumstances will be  about her actual circumstances. The thought is that in ideal conditions she  will care about what she would want to do and intend to do were she to be in less than ideal conditions. What she cares about in those circumstances  will be her “objectified subjective interests” (Railton, 1986, pp. 173–174).  And this agent’s nonmoral good is identified by Railton with her objectified  subjective interests. 

From here Railton proposes to get to moral norms, such as norms constituting a kind of definition of moral rightness, in two big steps:
1. First off he suggests that people have reasons to do what is in their individual objectified subjective interests. Thus we can evaluate actions in terms of how well  they serve the agent’s objectified subjective interests. And we can say that  an agent is rational to do what best serves these interests. So we have a  notion of individual rationality, one that requires a certain amount of trading off between individual objectified interests over time and the like, but  one that we might imagine tracks what the agent would choose in ideal  conditions. 
2. We can, Railton thinks, apply something like that notion to a  different kind of problem, and that constitutes the second big step. The  problem is that of weighing up the intrinsic interests of everyone in such a  way that the interests of each count equally. And when we do that we are  now concerned with social rationality. Outcomes will be morally good if  they are socially rational. Actions, policies, and courses of action will be  right if they are what it is socially rational to choose. Or, to say what is  supposed to be the same thing, they are right when they promote the moral  good.

## Reforming definition

Railton makes no claim  to have captured the existing meanings of the terms he analyzes. Rather he  proposes these as possible replacements for our current vocabulary.

## Good vs Right

Both Railton and Boyd start with good and then, from here, they find what is right.
