Let’s look at Tim Scanlon’s (2014) proposal, for  an example. Scanlon is willing to say something about the structure of basic  normative properties so he is not treating them as simple and unstructured.  Scanlon thinks we can explain all other normative properties as reason-giving  properties. An action will be morally wrong, on his view, if there is a certain  kind of reason for not doing it. And an action will be permissible if it isn’t  wrong. It will be required if not doing it is wrong, and so on. So the supervenience of these moral properties on other properties will depend on the  supervenience of reasons on these properties. 

Reasons, Scanlon further tells  us, are facts that fill a certain place in a four-place relation: “is a reason for” is a four-place relation, R(p, x, c, a), holding between  a fact p, an agent x, a set of conditions c, and an action or attitude a.  This is the relation that holds just in case p is a reason for a person x  in situation c to do or hold a. (Scanlon, 2014, p. 31).

There is already a little bit of help in the structure of the  four-place relation insofar as the structure makes clear that whether a fact  is a reason for a person or not depends on the conditions in which that fact  occurs. And this helps to make clear that at least potentially the very same  fact p, in a different context would not be a reason for even the very same  agent. If the context is a set of natural facts, this structure helps highlight  one kind of natural variation that would lead to a difference in which facts  are reasons. It doesn’t appear to be a full explanation yet, but it does seem  to make the supervenience relation less opaque.
