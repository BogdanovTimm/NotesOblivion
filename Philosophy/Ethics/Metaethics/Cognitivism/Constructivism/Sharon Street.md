She is a thoroughgoing constructivist about  all things normative. She thinks that reasons themselves can be given a  response dependent and seemingly nonnormative reduction: 

According to metaethical constructivism, the fact that X is a reason to  Y for agent A is constituted by the fact that the judgement that X is a  reason to Y (for A) withstands scrutiny from the standpoint of Aâ€™s other  judgements about reasons. (p. 223) 

So this is a version of reductive naturalism of the general  sort.
