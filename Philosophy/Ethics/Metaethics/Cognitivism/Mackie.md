# Arguments

## Argument for Error Theory

1. **Moral judgements** predicate properties that are capable of **motivating those who apprehend them**, just in virtue of being recognized. *(indefeasible [[Internalism]])*
2. **No beliefs** are such that they **must motivate** anyone **without cooperation from other** contingent **features of the agentâ€™s psychology**. 
3. Thus the **properties predicated by moral judgements** are **not instantiated**. 
4. And thus the **judgements** predicating these properties are **false** or suffer from presupposition failure. 

## Argument for Error Theory 2

There are no objective valid Categorical Imperatives.

Categorical Imperatives require morals/reasons existence [[Internalism]].

1. A **moral judgement** to the effect that such-and-such is morally required  predicates a property of that act-type that **gives any agent** in a position to do it a **reason to do it**, a **reason that is not contingent on any desires** that  the agent might have or lack. *(Moral judgements = Categorical Imperatives. Morals/reasons existence [[Internalism]])*
2. **All reasons to act depend on the desires** of the agent for they are reasons. *(Version of Humean theory of reasons aka Subjectivism. Reasons/motives existence [[Internalism]])*
3. Thus the **properties predicated by** such **moral judgements** are **not  instantiated**. 
4. And thus the **judgements** predicating these properties **are false** or suffer  from presupposition failure.
