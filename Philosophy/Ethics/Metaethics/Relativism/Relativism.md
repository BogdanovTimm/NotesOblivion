# Why

Because it allows us to keep minimal realism while saying that some groups of people share common moral positions and definitions. Between are also no disagreement - because different groups mean different things when they talk about `good` or `bad`, just like you can talk about `Mars` as planet or `god`.

Cultural relativism is a better choice than the personal one, because if every man has different moral language - it doesn't clear how they may communicate about morality at all.

# Hare's Counter Argument

`Good` is what people strive for, so, even if different cultures uses different words - they strive to something, so, we can conclude that they strive to `good`.

Later, Haare's descendants Terry Horgan and Mark Timmons offer their Moral Twin-Earth argument as an adaptation of this argument, because new linguistic theories destroy Haare's argument.
