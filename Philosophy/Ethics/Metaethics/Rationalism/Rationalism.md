# Definition

Rationalism is an example of a position that can show up on many branches  of our taxonomy. 

It has cognitivist and noncognitivist variants. 

It is consistent  with both naturalism and nonnaturalism. 

Rationalism, in the present sense,  is a normative-to-normative reductive thesis. It reduces facts about morality  to facts about practical rationality and/or practical reasons. Typically the  strategy is to identify moral facts with facts about practical rationality or  reasons that have a certain sort of (distinctively moral) ground, such as  altruism or respect and so on. 

The upshot of such a reduction would be  that moral obligation is a species of rational obligation even if every rational  obligation is not a moral obligation. Or, to put the point in terms of reasons,  morality would favor an agent’s following a course of action just when  practical reasons of the right sort favor that course of action. So the view  immediately entails an indefeasible form of morals/reasons existence  internalism.

A rationalist might go on to give a nonnatural account of reasons. Scanlon’s  position in the previous section is an example of such a view, at least if we  read him as thinking that everyone has a reason to try to cooperate with  others on terms they can’t reasonably reject. But a rationalist could think  that reasons can be naturalized, perhaps even in a reductive way. This is  Mark Schroeder’s (2007) idea. These theories are both minimally realist and  cognitivist. 

But Gibbard’s proposal that we briefly considered in section 14.1  implements a noncognitivist version of rationalism. Rationality talk is given  a noncognitivist gloss, and all other normative discourse is then analyzed in  terms of reasons. And moral judgements are included, although in a somewhat complicated way. 

Rationalism is a species of morals/reasons existence internalism. True moral  claims are claims about the reasons a person has, so they have the tightest  possible connection with reasons.
