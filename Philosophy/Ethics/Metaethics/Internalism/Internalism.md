# Definition

To be `metaethical internalist` is either:
- to believe that ethics may motivate someone to act
- to believe that ethics always motivate someone to act


# Types of Internalism

Types of Internalism:
- Group 1:
	- Morals/reasons = belief that moral judgments must have a connection with reasons.
	- Morals/motives = belief that moral judgments must have a connection with motives
	- Reasons/motives = belief that reasons must have a connection with motives
- Group 2:
	- Judgment internalism - moral judgements must be connected with reasons or motives
	- Existence internalism - moral facts (properties) must be connected with reasons or motives
- Group 3:
	- Defeasible internalism - Morals or reasons may motivate someone (for example, only rational agents. Irrational people will not be motivated by their moral positions)
	- Indefeasible internalism - morals or reasons always motivate someone

You need to combine properties of all 3 groups, so you may be an `indefeasible morals/motives judgment internalist` and so on.

# Notes

It should be related with Humean idea that motives for action must be based on pre-existing desire.
