# Definition

## Reconstruction 1

1. We can meaningfully ask, “Is `that which we desire to desire` = `good`?” (though, there can be every other definition of the `good`)  *(Premise)*
2. We could not meaningfully ask, “Is `what we desire to desire` = `what we desire to desire`?” *(Premise)*
3. An analysis of a concept captures the contribution of that concept to the contents of thoughts in which they occur. *(Premise)*
4. If we analyze `good` as `what we desire to desire`, the question in 1 should be analyzed as asking something equivalent to, “Is `what we desire to desire` = `what we desire to desire`?” *(From 1 and 3)*
5. If one can meaningfully use a sentence to express a thought, one can  meaningfully use any sentence that would be used in giving a correct analysis of the contents expressed by the first sentence to express the same thought. *(Premise)*
6. Thus, “Is `what we desire to desire` = `what we desire to desire`?” is not a correct analysis of “Is `what we desire to desire` = `good`?” *(From 4 and 5)*
7. Thus also, that `such-and-such` = `good` is not the same thought as the thought that `such-and-such` = `what we desire`. *(From 3 and 6)* [from Metaethics: A contemporary Introduction] 

### Counter argument using Frege's philosophy of language

Moore assumes that 2 terms should have same sense to have same meaning. But, in Frege's philosophy of language, it is not true, because `H20` and `water` may have same referent, but do not have same sense - so, `H20` and `water` have different meanings, but same referent. Same, `good` and, for example, `pleasure` will have different meanings, but same referent [from Metaethics: A contemporary Introduction]. 

## Reconstruction 2

This reconstruction of Moore's Open Arguments cannot be destroyed by Frege's philosophy of language.

1. Moore wonders whether `pleasure` = `good`. *(Premise)* 
2. When you wonder whether `something` = `good` you don’t believe that it is `good`. *(Premise)*
3. Moore does not believe `pleasure` = `good`. *(From 1. and 2.)*
4. Moore believes that `goodness` = `good`. *(Premise)* 
5. So, `goodness` and `pleasantness` differ in respect of what Moore believes about them. (He believes that one is good, but he isn’t sure about the other.) 
6. But by the **principle of the indiscernibility of identicals**, if `X` is identical with `Y`, then `X` and `Y` are indiscernible, that is they have all their properties in common. *(Premise—sometimes known as **Leibniz’s Law**)*
7. Thus `goodness` and `pleasantness` are distinct. *(From 5. and 6.)*
