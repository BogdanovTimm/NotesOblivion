# Assumptions

There are some difference between:
- Talking about a belief - 'I believe my car is red'
- Expressing a belief - 'My car is red' - it assumes that I believe in that

[[Humean Motivation Theory]] and Humean Reason Theory are both true.

There are 2 kinds of mental states:
- Beliefs aka cognitive states -  they tell us how things are, aim at truth, and are true  when they represent the world as it is. 
- Desires aka noncognitive states - motivate us to act. If they represent anything at all, they represent goals. If we canâ€™t achieve that goal - the state is not therefore defective or untrue.

Indefeasible morals/motives [[Internalism]] is true.
