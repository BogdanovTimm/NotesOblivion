On R. M.  Hare’s more complex view, Universal Prescriptivism (Hare, 1952), moral  claims were generalized imperatives not translatable in other terms. These  imperatives prescribed and proscribed the actions they targeted along with any relevantly similar actions done in appropriately similar circumstances.

So `X` is right would mean something similar to, ‘You all do  `X` and any relevantly similar actions in similar circumstances.’ 

The ‘universal’  in “universal prescriptivism” expresses the idea that these prescriptions apply  to anyone in a sufficiently similar situation, including the agent of the action,  the audience, and the maker of the judgement. 

It is more difficult to jump  directly from this idea to a commitment about the nature of moral beliefs  than it is to make the analogous jump from emotivist accounts of moral  language to an account of moral belief and acceptance. That’s because it isn’t  obvious that someone has to be in any particular state of mind either to  issue a command or to accept it. Still, Hare did suggest that accepting an  imperative involves a commitment to following through on the action it  recommends.
