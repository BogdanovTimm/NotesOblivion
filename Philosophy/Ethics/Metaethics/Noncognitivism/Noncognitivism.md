# Definition

Moral judgements are not about emotions or attitudes, whether actual or hypothetical.

Moral judgements express these attitudes without talking about them.

Noncognitivism, thus, develops the underlying motivations for simple subjectivism in a radically different direction.

Noncognitivists reject the representational picture shared by both simple and complex subjectivist theories. In rejecting that picture  they reject minimal realism.

The crucial part of the noncognitivist view is  thus double-barreled and negative: 
- Semantic nonrepresentationalism - Moral sentences don’t represent the  world in the way other sentences in the indicative mood normally do - they are not descriptive
- Psychological noncognitivism  - Moral “beliefs” don’t represent the world in the way that genuine  beliefs do - they are not cognitive states

# Assumptions

Moral judgements = the psychological states  we attribute when we say someone believes (for example) that lying is wrong

There are 2 types of mental:
- cognitive - ones that represents the world
- conative - desires, emotions - states that are allegedly directed at the world, but nonrepresentational

# Pros

- They resist to Open Question Argument
- They don't need any new property - either natural or non-natural
