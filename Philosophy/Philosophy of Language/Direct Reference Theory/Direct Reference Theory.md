# Definition

It is about [[Metasemantics]].

Terms contributed the items for which they stood directly to the contents of the sentences and thought they  expressed. The “directly” here is meant to contrast with the indirect way the  referent of a term is contributed to content according to standard Fregean  theories, where the referent has to satisfy a descriptive sense, one which is  according to these theories also part of the meaning they contribute. 

For example:

`Hasheem Tahbeet is fluent in French and Swahili` means directly what it means, whereas in Fregean Theories, it would mean `There is exactly one tallest active professional basketball player and she or he is fluent in French  or Swahili`.

So, names are just tags.

The  name is the semantic value of the term. The story is an account of how it  gets that semantic value. The simplest such stories for names involve some event in the past where the name gets associated with a particular person.  

# Predecessors


John Stuart Mill’s view that the referent of a term just was the meaning of the term that named it.
